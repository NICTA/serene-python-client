"Homer's painting cleverly refers to the rising American temperance movement, a crusade against drinking alcohol, by depicting a stout milkmaid pausing while a farmhand drinks from her ladle. Swaying under the weight of her pail and squinting into the sun, she presents the ideal of natural womanhood. Her powerful presence, marked by broad shoulders, muscular arms, and sunburned skin, counters the farmhand's relaxed stance and shaded face, visually reversing traditional gender roles.

Homer visited the Adirondacks as one of many vacationers who flocked there in the late nineteenth century.

"Transatlantic travel looks like fun in Homers recollection of his own trip to France in 186667. Stylish passengers stroll the deck, read, doze, uncork bottles, and inspect the marine life via telescope, seemingly unfazed by the steep tilt of their vulnerable, wooden world. Employed as an illustrator of topics from modern life, Homer had a sharp eye for fashion, leisure activity, and pretty girls.

"American Rockingham wares were popular in the Unites States from the mid-nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries.

The factory became known for its mottled manganese-brown glazes and for its relief-molded decorations, often in the revived Rococo style (characterized by the use of leaf and flower motifs, curves and sinuous lines, and organic forms).
