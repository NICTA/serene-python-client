            Although Hopper is best known for his views of New York interiors and buildings, he also painted landscapes
            that capture the starkness of rural New England.
            Devoid of people, Hopper’s landscapes have an abandoned atmosphere that echoes the loneliness and isolation
            of his urban scenes.
            This canvas, named after the East Coast railroad line, was painted during the Depression and depicts a
            landscape and desolate house along the railroad tracks. The prominence of the tracks suggests Hopper’s
            recurring theme of transience and the solitude of the traveler.

            Henri’s urban realist circle. Under Henri’s leadership Sloan and seven other artists opposed the traditional
            hold that that the National Academy of Design had exerted over art in America.  In 1908 the group, which
            became known as The Eight held an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery in New York.  Sloan and four other members
            of the group painted down-to-earth subject matter which earned them the epithet of Ashcan School, because

            lower East Side with broad, vigorous strokes and a conscious avoidance of sentimentality. Sloan taught at

            Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana
            State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was
            anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The
            compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at
            the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston
            Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit
            Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar
            Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the
            Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted
            landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling
            during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.
            Richardson recalled that the site of this painting was the front yard of her family’s home at 4314 North
            Central in Indianapolis. Yet Richardson’s lush green neighborhood scene transcends any specific place to
            become a symbol of traditional middle-class America during the 1930s. The yards are large and well tended,
            and the house across the street, characteristic of the days before air conditioning, has a broad, striped
            awning.  Girls in dresses play under the streetlight, a watchful mother include din its reassuring glow. 
            Richardson’s vision of the scene reduces figures, trees, even shadows to simplified geometric forms.  The
            result is a painting that breathes the essence of a summer evening.  Very little imagination is required to
            hear the gentle nocturnal sounds of crickets and cicadas.

            Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.  Hays drew on

            after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living. 
            In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm.  He tinted
            photographs and painted over enlarged prints.  Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among
            his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.  Much of his renown came from his ability
            to convince Chase’s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.  Hays was successful

            J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young
            Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a
            year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John
            Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He
            returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy
            with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting
            at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up
            a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the
            Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that
            traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group. 
            Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of
            Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region’s artists.  In 1898,
            Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901,
            Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from
            1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as
            Brookville.    
            Shown in New York in 1886, Wash Day, Bavaria is the first painting Adams sent to America for exhibition.  It
            may be surprising the artist would have chosen this kind of simple scene from everyday life for his debut.

            England in 1763, where he remained for the rest of his career. The setting for this landscape is the Queen's
            Lodge in the Great Park at Windsor, where woodcutters are shown making a clearing to provide a ""view."" Such
            vistas were an essential part of 18th-century English landscape design. The landscape was painted the same
            year West began work on a major cycle of decorations for the chapel at Windsor Castle.

            him to Scotland, but his mentor’s death forced Stuart back to America.  During the Revolutionary War, he
            returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West.  As success came, so did debt which
            forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded
            portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using
            any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important
            political figures.  One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the “Athenaeum Head” currently
            on the dollar bill.
            In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British

            Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life.  Born in
            North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took
            him to Scotland, but his mentor’s death forced Stuart back to America.  During the Revolutionary War, he
            returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West.  As success came, so did debt which
            forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded
            portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using
            any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important
            political figures.  One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the “Athenaeum Head” currently
            on the dollar bill.
            In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British
            portraiture.  The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boy’s
            jacket move the viewer’s eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple,
            elegant, robe à l’anglaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period.  The woman’s hair is lightly
            powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure à l'hérisson, or “hedgehog,” in which the hair was cut short
            in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face.

        ",path,"
            T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art
            classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland
            Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who
            became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the
            funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive
            than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to
            Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of
            them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana
            countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and
            gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists
            known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including
            William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the
            American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home
            that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.
            The Bloom of the Grape, painted in Vernon, Indiana, in early November 1893 during what Steele called “a
            glorious autumn,” is the artist’s best-known landscape.  Its title refers to the white gauzy veil, known as
            “bloom,” covering grapes at harvest time.  Steele wrote to his wife that he had never seen better color,
            “such dull reads and crimsons and faded yellows and oranges, in juxtaposition with such royal purples.”
            These rich color harmonies are captured in this painting in a manner that critic Charles F. Browne described
            as conservatively impressionistic, but not wild.  The luminosity and color harmonies found in Bloom of the
            Grape exemplify the new approach to landscape painting that would earn Steele national recognition for his
            modified Impressionist style.

            that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of
            sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in
            Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835
            painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with
            John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,
            Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen

            the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He
            continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. 
            Brook in Summer reflects Cox’s high regard for traditional, pastoral landscapes filled with lush scenery and
            soft light.  Cox varies the format of the traditional landscape by placing the trees, bushes and fallen
            branches randomly, as they appear in nature, rather than in an idealized order.  This setting is probably a
            composite of sketches of the Indianapolis countryside and views invented by Cox.

            T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art
            classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland
            Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who
            became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the
            funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive
            than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to
            Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of
            them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana
            countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and
            gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists
            known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including
            William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the
            American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home
            that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.
            Pleasant Run has been called the masterpiece of Steele’s Munich manner.  It was painted within months of the
            artist’s return from five years of study in Germany, where he became increasingly devoted to painting from
            nature.  The canvas’s dark tonalities, backlighting, and even its composition, relate to Steele’s scenes of
            Bavaria.  Yet as the artist noted in his journal, he remained sensitive to the nuances of the Indiana
            landscape, carefully recording its color contrasts and clear light.  In 1885 when T. C. Steele painted this
            landscape, Pleasant Run defined the eastern and southern limits of Indianapolis.  The area depicted here was
            located just north of Irvington at the southwest corner of what is now Arlington and Tenth Street.

            William Forsyth was born in California, Ohio, not far from Cincinnati. His early use of the family’s walls
            as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity. 
            When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.  Forsyth started his art
            studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.  He earned his living painting houses with his brother and
            used his free time to explore his artistic talents.  Forsyth became on of the first student in the newly
            established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.  His desire for
            more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the
            Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these
            trips home to sell at exhibitions.  When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two
            years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.  After the school closed,
            Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933. 
            Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took
            commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the
            Depression.  In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.
            In 1883 William Forsyth entered the Technical Painting Class of Ludwig von Löfftz, where he received a full
            grounding the painting of portrait heads and figure studies.  In this canvas painted about midway through
            his six-year stay in Europe, Forsyth focuses on the time-worn quality of the woman’s hands and facial
            features.  Old Market Woman exemplifies the Munich School’s dark tonality and bravura brushwork, derived
            from the 17th-century Dutch portraits of Rembrandt and Hals.

            Determined to be an artist, Scudder left Terre Haute, Indiana in her teens to study at the Academy of Art in
            Cincinnati.  By age 20 she was one of Lorado Taft’s “white rabbits,” the female assistants who aided him in
            his many sculpture projects for the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.  In 1894 she sought
            training in France, where she eventually established her home and studio.  Active beyond her work as a
            sculptor, Scudder participated in the women’s suffrage movement in the United States, wrote an autobiography
            entitled Modelling My Life, and was honored by France as a Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur.  Scudder came
            back to the United States nearly every year to seek fountain projects from landscape architects. During the
            early 20th century a wide-spread American demand for garden sculpture provided Scudder with many
            commissions, earning her the title “Woman of the Fountains.”
            As a young artist in France, Scudder persuaded the successful American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to
            break his rule against taking students. Scudder incorporated MacMonnies lively naturalistic modeling into
            Frog Fountain. She said that this bronze was inspired by children she observed in Italy, a country renowned
            for its fountain sculpture.  The chubby little boy, his hair garlanded with flowers, dances between three

            Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early
            employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that
            combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that
            time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in
            Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper
            illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among
            his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to
            attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local
            models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich’s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana
            patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States,
            where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of
            forty-three.
            The course of study in the Technical Painting Class at the Royal Academy in Munich consisted of rigorous
            instruction in the painting of heads, followed by full figure work.  This procedure continued the teaching
            methods begun in the drawing classes, where the major portion of the day was spent rendering portrait
            studies of elderly peasant types.  Using the masters of Dutch 17th-century portraiture, Rembrandt and Hals,
            as prototypes, Löfftz had his students restrict the basic harmony of their paintings to soft, shadowy grays,
            relieved only by sharp details in the highlights.  Here the contours of the man’s white shirt stand out
            against the dark tonalities and ease the severity of the composition.

            At the Royal Academy, Professor von Löfftz’s perfectionism was legendary. Emphasizing the dark tonalities of
            the Old Dutch Masters, he demanded that his students restrict their palettes to carefully modulated browns,
            ochres, grays, and off-whites with the intention of reigning in impulses toward harsh local colors.  His
            policy of reducing color to a narrow range of harmonies drove the more impulsive students to distraction.  
            A Swiss artist complained: “In my study of that woman I was well on my way to losing the color altogether as
            I continually tried to subdue the tone toward gray.”  Such struggles are evident in Richards’s portraits
            with their emphasis on dark tonalities devoid of high key color.

            T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art
            classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland
            Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who
            became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the
            funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive
            than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to
            Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of
            them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana
            countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and
            gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists
            known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including
            William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the
            American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home
            that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.
            The young woman in Steele’s canvas represents a departure from the Royal Academy’s preference for older
            models.  This attractive figure, whose youthful facial features emerge from the dark shadows, is rendered in
            brown tonalities against an unadorned, dark background.  The setting and execution exemplify the austere
            style espoused by Germany’s Royal Academy teachers.  Löfftz was prone to severe criticism of the “sweet
            color” in his students’ work and praised such somber and meditative images as Munich Girl.

            Winter was born in England and came to America in 1830 to study in New York.  In 1837 he moved to
            Logansport, Indiana.

            George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America
            in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon
            hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what
            became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their
            culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in
            California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known
            primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose
            not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is
            also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians
            and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief. 
            Winter’s arrival in Logansport, Indiana, coincided with the last months of the Potawatomi in Indiana.  His
            ambition to record, with an ethnographer’s attention to detail, the daily life and customs of the Wabash
            Potawatomi resulted in scores of drawings, made between 1837 and 1838, which served as the basis for Indian
            paintings such as Scene on the Wabash. The Potawatomi’s contented expressions are at odds with the overall
            melancholy of the barren landscape.  Winter often included a dead tree in his Potawatomi pictures as a
            symbol of their removal from native lands.

            J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young
            Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a
            year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John
            Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He
            returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy
            with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting
            at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up
            a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the
            Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that
            traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group. 
            Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of
            Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region’s artists.  In 1898,
            Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901,
            Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from
            1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as
            Brookville.    
            Brookville, just a few miles southwest of Indianapolis, was far removed from the bustle of the city. 
            Although only a small town in Morgan County, it was easily accessible by railroad.  Local historians do not
            remember the exact location of Thornberry’s pasture.  In this picturesque view of an autumn afternoon, Adams
            achieves the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a specific moment.  The setting sun
            leaves the foreground landscape in deep shadow, the grassy terrain dappled with sunlight, and the middle
            ground fully engulfed in a flowing autumnal light.  Adams uses a vertical canvas to place a strong emphasis
            on the trees that blanket the blue sky with their orange foliage.

            George Winter was born in England, where he studied four years at the Royal Academy before coming to America
            in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon
            hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what
            became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their
            culture.  After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in
            California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known
            primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose
            not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is
            also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians
            and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief. 
            Winter’s early training in England exposed him to the traditional pastoral, classically inspired landscapes
            modeled after the work of 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain.  Although this canvas purportedly
            depicts a view of the Wabash River near Lafayette, the graceful trees that frame the foreground, the
            measured recession of space, and the warm, dusky light suggest that it is a thoroughly idealized scene.
            Landscapes that partially transformed the untamed Indiana countryside into an orderly, ideal world probably
            appealed to Winter’s purchasers.

            hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what
            became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their

            California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known
            primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose
            not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is
            also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians
            and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief.

            T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art
            classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland
            Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who
            became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the
            funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive
            than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to
            Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of
            them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana
            countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and
            gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists
            known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including
            William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the
            American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home
            that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.
            Situated between the German towns of Dachau and Schleissheim, the Dachau Moor was a favorite painting spot
            for Steele and Forsyth.  It offered a serene landscape where the Hoosier artists could spend undisturbed
            hours sketching and painting.  Here in the dwindling late afternoon light, Steele captures the essence of
            the quiet scene.  In this richly r=textured landscape, the thick areas of white suggest reflections from the
            sun’s descending rays on the rippling water. The sense of solitude is broken only by the two peasant women
            fathering reeds in the dimly lit landscape.  Painted near the end of his stay in Munich, the dark,
            gray-green tonality of Late Afternoon is a legacy of Steele’s academic training.

            J. Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana.  The young
            Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a
            year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John
            Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams.  He
            returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie.  In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy
            with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards.  Adams studied drawing and painting
            at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich.  When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up
            a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes.  In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the
            Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that
            traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago.  A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group. 
            Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of
            Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the region’s artists.  In 1898,
            Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage.  In 1901,
            Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from
            1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as
            Brookville.    
            This study of a half-draped man was probably painted during the two years Adams spent in Professor Löfftz’s
            Technical Painting Class.  The unidealized figure sits in a dramatically lit interior, animated by contrasts
            of light and dark.  A thread of light describes the contour of the model and catches in its aura the
            smallest nuances of hair on the head, chin, chest, arms, and back.  These effects can result only from the
            closest and most time consuming study.  Such labor was expected of the students in Löfftz’s painting class.

            Wayman Adams was born on a farm near Muncie Indiana to a Quaker father who was a livestock breeder and
            amateur artist. Adams’ father encouraged his interest in art.  The first portrait commission the young boy
            received was a picture of a heifer named “Gypsy Girl III” for which he was paid five dollars.  In 1904 Adams
            began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying
            under William Forsyth.  In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in
            Italy.  A few years later he made a similar trip to Spain with Robert Henri.  Adams’ developed a style of
            “alla-prima” painting, which means “all at once,” is a method of painting in which the work is completed in
            one sitting, usually without the use of glazing or underpainting.  These rapidly painted works contain
            energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images.  Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects
            included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses,
            military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors.  “At one point in his career,
            Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia.  During the winter he traveled
            extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects. 
            In terms of awards and honors, Adams may be Herron’s most successful alumnus, winning prizes in most of the
            major national competitions during his 60-year career.  This portrait of the conductor of the Indianapolis
            Orchestra, Alexander Ernestinoff, won the Proctor Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1914 and
            vaulted Adams into the ranks of the country’s leading portraitists.  The flowing brushwork reveals the
            influence of Adams’ principal teacher at Herron, William Forsyth, as well as his instruction in New York
            with the American masters of bravura painting, Robert Henri and William Merritt Chase.  In keeping with
            Chase and Henri’s method of rapid execution, Adams is reported to have completed the Ernestinoff likeness in
            just three hours.  According to Adams’ account of the sitting, Ernestinoff came into the studio and casually
            dropped into a chair, still wearing his hat and overcoat.  The relaxed pose so appealed to Adams’ love of
            the spontaneous that it became the basis for the portrait.

            John Washington Love arrived in Indianapolis with his parents when he was ten years old.  After studying in
            the public schools and Northwestern Christian University, Love decided to become an artist.  He entered the
            studio of Barton Hays and later went to Cincinnati to continue his studies.  After a year he went to New
            York and entered the School of the National Academy of Design.  He then traveled to Paris and was the first
            Indiana artist to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Atélier Gérôme where he studied for four years. 
            After six years of European study, Love return to Indianapolis and set up the first Indiana School of Art
            with fellow artist James F. Gookins. Love’s promising career was cut short with his death at the age of
            thirty.
            After Love returned from study in France, his interest in landscape painting continued.  The influence of
            the French Barbizon painters is apparent in the dark tones and the loose, broken brushstrokes that sweep
            across the canvas.  In this Indianapolis landscape scene, the tradition of the Barbizon painters is mingled
            with Love’s own individual style

            Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in
            separate ferry accidents.  Cox’s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By
            that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of
            sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in
            Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835
            painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with
            John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,
            Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen
            and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National
            Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When
            the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He
            continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. 
            Cox often modeled his landscapes after the calm, pastoral views of Hudson River school painters, such as
            Asher B. Durand. Landscape near Indianapolis may depict a stretch of Fall Creek north of the city, an area
            Cox frequently painted.  The three figures in the lower left could be a family about to begin the arduous
            transformation from the frontier into the orderly Indiana farmland pictured in the distance.  The bridge in
            the composition’s center reinforces the idea of transition from wilderness to productive land.  Cox’s soft
            brushwork and saturated pastel palette convey a sense of optimism about life in Indiana in the 1860s.

            Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.  Hays drew on
            barn walls with charcoal and saw his first oil painting at age twenty.  He moved to northern Indiana, where
            after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living. 
            In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm.  He tinted
            photographs and painted over enlarged prints.  Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among
            his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.  Much of his renown came from his ability
            to convince Chase’s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.  Hays was successful
            in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison’s portrait.  He was one of the original
            members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
            Hay’s likeness of Dr. Lyons is typical of early American portraits.  The seated half-length figure is placed
            against a plain background.  His hands and face are emphasized by contrasting the skin tones and the white
            shirt against the dark setting.  Facial features are carefully rendered in firm brushstrokes.  The sitter
            holds a book on his lap as a symbol of higher learning and his own accomplishments.

            Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father’s business failed, the family moved to
            Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Académie Colarossi and
            the Académie Julian. Whether in Paris, Venice, or Boston, Prendergast was attracted to the vivid parade of
            everyday life. He became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert
            Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens. 
            Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly
            contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have been described as
            tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored
            people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Until 1904 he worked almost
            exclusively in watercolor. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors
            and later oils depicting bustling crowds. Prendergast is one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of
            Cézanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  His brother Charles was an
            important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brother’s work.
            Prendergast translated the bustling activity of busy park scenes or passing crowds into flat, bold areas of
            percolating color arranged like a loosely knit tapestry of contrasting shapes and forms.  While his
            technique became progressively decorative, Prendergast’s themes remained consistent.  The site for Park
            Salem  is believed to be a marine park near Salem, Massachusetts.

            Jacob Cox was born in Burlington New Jersey, the first of ten children born to a Quaker couple who died in
            separate ferry accidents.  Cox’s grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians.  By
            that time the young Cox was already interested in art.  He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of
            sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in
            Indianapolis.  The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time.  By 1835
            painting portraits was added to Cox’s business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with
            John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,
            Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen
            and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National
            Academy of Design.  Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.  When
            the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers.  He
            continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one. 
            Farmyard Scene displays an unqualified enthusiasm for the vitality, bounty, and sheer visual appeal of rural
            life.  Cox continually searched for themes that would appeal to Midwestern patrons, and images of prosperity
            derived from working the land must have been popular subjects.  The European style of the architecture in
            Farmyard Scene suggests that Cox was probably inspired by Dutch and English painting.  Perhaps he was
            striving to elevate the familiar barnyard scenery through associations with Old World culture.  In this
            canvas Cox gave prominence to the natural beauty and vigor of the animals and relegated the two women and
            the buildings to the shadowed areas of the scene.

            sitter's beard, hair and glasses, is evidence of Hays' skill as a portrait painter.
            Much of Hays' renown came from his having tutored William Merritt Chase, but his reputation rested on the
            quality of his portraits and fruit still lifes.

            Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.  Hays drew on
            barn walls with charcoal and saw his first oil painting at age twenty.  He moved to northern Indiana, where
            after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living. 
            In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm.  He tinted
            photographs and painted over enlarged prints.  Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among
            his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.  Much of his renown came from his ability
            to convince Chase’s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.  Hays was successful
            in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison’s portrait.  He was one of the original
            members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
            The Sewells, residents of Covington, Indiana, were painted using the dark tonalities and unadorned
            background typically found in nineteenth-century portraiture.  The meticulous rendering of the sitters’
            glasses, the careful delineation of William Sewell’s thinning hair and full beard and Eusebia Sewell’s
            delicate lace collar with its prominent cameo pin exemplify the quality and attention to detail typical of
            Hays’ portrait style.

        ",,"
            Robert Henri was born Robert Henry Cozad in Cincinnati, Ohio.  When Henri was ten years old, his father, a
            gambler and real estate promoter, shot someone in self defense.  The family feared for their safety, moved
            to Atlantic City, New Jersey, changed their name and passed their two sons off as adopted children.  Robert
            Henri chose a variation on his middle name as his surname and attended boarding school in New York City.  He
            received his art training at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then attended the Academy Julian
            in Paris.  After spending several years in Europe, Henri taught at the Chase School of Art and the New York
            School of Art where he led a fight against Academic views.  In 1909, Henri established his own school and
            organized “The Eight,” a group of artists that rejected the restraints from the National Academy of Design. 
            The Eight favored a style that portrayed contemporary everyday life.  Five members of this group, including
            Henri, became known as the Ashcan School because of their depictions of the seedy side of life.  Henri
            favored portraits of ordinary people, while the remainder of the group focused primarily on everyday street
            scenes.
            This portrait of professional model Edna Smith is typical of Henri’s ability to capture his subject’s
            spirit.  Around 1909, Henri adopted the color system of theorist Hardesty Maratta, which assigns a letter
            and number to 144 harmonically related colors.  Painters could use the system of letters and number to
            carefully plan the color relationships of their paintings.  The rich harmonies of this image based on red
            and green show Henri’s use of the Maratta system.

        ",,"
            Edmund Brucker was born in Cleveland, Ohio and trained at the Cleveland School of Art.  He was an
            accomplished painter working in a realist style when he joined the faculty of the John Herron Art Institute
            in Indianapolis, where he taught until his retirement. Though he was best known as a portrait painter,
            Brucker also painted regional scenes in both oil and watercolor.  Many of his works combine views from
            sketches and drawings he made of different sites during different times of the day.  His palette of rich
            gray tones emphasizes design, composition and line. As a portraitist, Brucker painted Indiana governor
            Matthew E. Welsh as well as family, friends. He painted several portraits of African Americans, other local
            citizens and fellow artists.
            Monday Morning is an example of the more modernist idiom Brucker experiments with during the 1940s. 
            Elements of cubism and a design as precise as an architect’s are present in the painting’s ruler straight
            lines, angularity, and compressed space.  Like other American artists of the time, Brucker painted back
            alleys and industrial landscapes, views which seem to capture the stress-filled American society of the
            1930s and 1940s.  The bright green spot of vegetation in the center of Brucker’s subdued colors and
            geometric shapes stands out as a symbol of nature and regeneration amid the urban environment.  Brucker’s
            inspiration for Monday Morning was a sketch he made on a sunny day in the Little Italy section of Cleveland,
            Ohio.  Monday Morning was exhibited widely, including, in 1947 at the annual national art competition
            sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.

            Arthur B. Davies was born in Utica, New York and exhibited his talent for painting when he was sixteen.  His
            family moved to Chicago where he studied at the Art Institute.  He went to New York City and continued his
            studies at the Art Students League, where he met Robert Henri and George Luks.  As with many of the artists
            who would later make up the group known as The Eight, Davies began his career as an illustrator.  He
            discovered his distinctive style of the female nude in a landscape setting around the turn of the
            twentieth-century.  Symbolic and poetic, these figures were posed in a frieze-like manner against
            mysteriously dark backgrounds and seemed to have their roots in mythology.  In 1908, Davies joined a group
            of artists at an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery which established these artists as “The Eight.”  Davies
            became president of the Society of Independent Artists and helped organize the 1913 Armory Show, which
            introduced the American public to European avant-garde trends.  While Cubism had a short and minor influence
            on Davies, he continued to focus on the idyllic figures that were the hallmark of his style.
            Many of Davies’ paintings exude a dream-like quality of detachment from the everyday world. In Across the
            Harbor the artist painted a group of female figures, posing their stylized forms in the frieze-like
            composition he often favored.  The unusual color scheme and the abrupt change of scale presented by the
            sailboat heighten the painting’s vague sense of otherworldly mystery.

            Ruth Pratt Bobbs was born into a moneyed family in Indianapolis, Indiana. When she was eight years old, her
            mother took her to Saturday art school.  At sixteen, after the death of her parents, Bobbs went to Paris,
            where she studied at the Académie Julian.  She returned to New York and enrolled in the Art Students
            League.  By the time she came back to Indianapolis to continue her training at the John Herron Art
            Institute, Bobbs had studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, Kenyon Cox and Frank Vincent DuMond. 
            She also worked with Charles Webster Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts.  At twenty-eight she married
            William C. Bobbs, president of the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company, a man twenty-three years her senior.
            After the death of her husband in 1926, Bobbs went back to Paris and opened a studio.  When she returned to
            Indianapolis, Bobbs opened a studio and gallery where she painted portraits of local citizens,
            entrepreneurs, and government leaders. Despite coming from a wealthy family and marrying into wealth, which
            created a great deal of skepticism regarding her sincerity as an artist, Bobbs proved she was serious by
            becoming a very successful portrait painter.
            When this figure study hung in Bobb’s Indianapolis living room, visitors often mistook it for a self
            portrait from her youth.  Although the sitter’s hat and cape did belong to the artist, the model was a young
            woman named Jesseca Penn.  While a student in New York, Bobbs met the Scotswoman who had just come to this
            country and was looking for work.  Bobbs painted her and then sent her to pose for Robert Henri who was
            teaching at the Chase School in New York.  The “read-haired model,” as she was later known, became a
            favorite of Henri and posed for many of his best pictures.  The Japanese screen, a stock motif employed by
            Bobbs’s teachers in Boston and New York, creates the bright tones that suffuse the picture.  Its vertical
            and diagonal bamboo stalks echo the lines of the sitter, deftly integrating the figure with the background.

        ",,"
            William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then
            briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase
            was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city’s Royal Academy.  In 1878, Chase
            returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style. 
            He was a member of America’s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely
            influential teacher.  Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in
            Shinnecock, Long Island.  He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the
            Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley,
            Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.
            In 1870 Chase moved to St. Louis, where his family had relocated after losing their shoe business in
            Indianapolis.  He hoped to support himself by satisfying the Victorian taste for still-life paintings of
            flowers and fruit.  This early example of Chase’s still-life painting suggests his awareness of other
            American artists.  The hummingbird motif probably derives from the work of Martin Johnson Heade, and the
            bouquet recalls John LaFarge’s floral arrangements.  Chase considered flowers “the most difficult” things to
            paint, which may account for their scarcity in his work. Yet in 1872 his success in still-life painting
            induced a group of local patrons to allow Chase to resume this education by sponsoring his attendance at the
            Royal Academy in Munich.

            in 1830 to continue his art education in New York. In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon
            hearing of the plight of northern Indiana’s Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what
            became known as “Potawatomi Trail of Death,” Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana to document their
            culture.  After thirteen years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in
            California.  Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known
            primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose
            not only convey the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is
            also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians
            and later became the wife of the tribe’s chief.

            posed in a casual setting, reflecting Winter’s goal of recording the daily life and customs of these people.
            This particular painting concentrates on family activities, particularly women washing clothes in the

            Students League.  Lawson spent time at the summer school of Cos Cob, Connecticut where he began painting out
            of doors.  He travelled to France to continue his studies in Paris at the Académie Julian and shared a
            studio with Somerset Maugham, who used Lawson as the prototype for Frederic Lawson in his novel, “Of Human
            Bondage.”  After returning to New York, Lawson settled in Washington Heights, an area he painted numerous
            times.  Lawson continued traveling, spending time in France, Spain and in New England painting in Cos Cob,
            Connecticut and Cornish, New Hampshire.  He taught at The Art Institute in Kansas City and Broadmoor

            Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his father’s business failed, the family came to
            Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist.  He studied in Paris at the Académie Colarossi and
            the Académie Julian.  Prendergast became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who
            included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William
            Glackens.  Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat
            areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning.  His complex arrangements have
            been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics.  Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight,
            Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Prendergast
            earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and oils depicting bustling crowds.  He
            is remembered today as one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of Cézanne and turn them into his
            personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism.  Prendergast’s brother Charles was an important frame maker
            whose frames can often be seen on his brother’s work.
            In Glimpse of the Harbor, Gloucester, Prendergast handles this watercolor view of the Massachusetts harbor
            with typical freedom, wielding thin washes in loosely knit strokes and allowing broad areas of the white
            paper to figure in the composition. Patterns contrast between rigid geometry and curvilinear forms.  The
            people are characteristically blended into the scene so they do not disturb the rhythm of the composition.

            George Luks was born in Williamsport, Pennsylvania and received his first art instruction from his parents
            who painted as a hobby.  His formal education began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then in
            Düsseldorf, Germany.  He also traveled to London and Paris returning to the United States to work as an
            artist for Philadelphia newspapers.  He roomed with fellow illustrator Everett Shinn and became acquainted
            with George Luks, William Glackens, John Sloan and later Robert Henri who, along with Shinn, became known as
            the Philadelphia Five.  Luks also drew comic strips, but gave up illustration to become a full time artist. 
            His career as an illustrator drew his interests to painting urban street scenes. Luks had a vibrant,
            sometime raucous, personality that is expressed in his lively portraits and urban subjects.  He joined
            Robert Henri’s circle in their depictions of city life and became part of the Ashcan School.   He was also a
            member of the rebellious group known as “The Eight” who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in New York in 1908. 
            Because Luks was a heavy drinker, he became involved in a barroom brawl that ended in his death.
            New Year’s Shooter dates from around the first exhibition of The Eight, who had banded together to oppose
            the rigid formulas of academic painting.  He shared with Robert Henri an energetic brushwork, patterned
            after the dynamic seventeenth-century Dutch painter Frans Hals.  Luks sympathized with the powerless –
            immigrants, the poor, children – and was at his best when portraying them.  The colorful palette of New
            Year’s Shooter is in tune with the gaiety and theatricality of the subject.

            for the school’s student yearbook.  Before graduating, he left Ohio State to study art in New York City
            where he became a student of Robert Henri at the New York School of Art.  Bellows became associated with
            Henri’s group which was known as “The Eight” and the Ashcan School. He taught at the Art Student League of
            New York, while painting urban New York scenes depicting working-class people.  His most important work was
            his series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches.
            Bellows’s fame grew and he began to receive portrait commissions from wealthy New Yorkers.  In addition to
            painting, Bellows made important contributions to lithography and created more than 100 images. During his
            later career, he illustrated a number of books, including several by H. G. Wells. 
            Portrait of a Boy depicts Meredith Hare, the young son of a wealthy family living in Tuxedo Park, New York. 
            In a letter to his wife, Bellows wrote that Mrs. Hare had asked for a picture of her son in a stiff white
            collar and formal pose.  Bellows fulfilled her request but then executed this portrait, which reveals the
            details of loose, soft clothing, tousled hair and inquisitive expression, the sitter’s charmingly boyish
            character.  Unable to decide which portrait she preferred, Mrs. Hare took neither.

            William Forsyth was born in California, Ohio, not far from Cincinnati. His early use of the family’s walls
            as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity. 
            When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis.  Forsyth started his art
            studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen.  He earned his living painting houses with his brother and
            used his free time to explore his artistic talents.  Forsyth became the first student in the newly
            established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school.  His desire for
            more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the
            Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these
            trips home to sell at exhibitions.  When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two
            years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams.  After the school closed,
            Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933. 
            Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took
            commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the
            Depression.  In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.
            Ohio River Boat is one of Forsyth’s paintings produced for the Public Works of Art Project.  The scene may
            depict the landing at Madison, Indiana.  Relying on his extensive outdoor painting experience, Forsyth
            created the intense, humid light of a landscape painted directly from nature.  His animated brushwork belies
            the fact that he was physically weakened by his heart attack.

            School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Weaver traveled to Mexico and Europe.  He maintained a studio in
            New York’s Greenwich Village for two years.  He was the young painter to be awarded the Julius Halgarten for
            a circus painting shown at the Annual National Academy of design exhibition in New York City.  He also
            exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The Corcoran Biennial, the Carnegie International
            and the San Francisco World’s Fair.  After returning to Indiana, Weaver served as foreman in a machine
            company until he received a commission in the U. S. Navy.  He retired from the Navy with the rank of
            Lieutenant and a year later joined the faculty of the Herron School of Art where he taught painting, mural
            design, drawing and illustration. Weaver was president of the Circus City Festival, Inc. and piloted a
            beautification program known as “Operation Facelift” in Peru, Indiana for which he was voted “Man of the
            Year.”
            Weaver’s Peru birthplace was the winter home to most of America’s great circuses.  He spent his free time
            around circus people and took a job as a ticket taker at a sideshow, so he could become a part of the world
            he had grown to love.  His favorite painting subject was circus life.  In Circus Poster, a large brick home
            sits in the distance snow-covered landscape, while a dilapidated wood building is set in the foreground. 
            The bare trees and darkened sky give the scene an eerie quality.  The circular roadway surrounding the

            William Henry Hilliard was born in Auburn, New York.  He moved to Madison, Indiana and ten years later to
            Indianapolis. Before arriving in Indiana, Hilliard was a sailor, a landscape painter in the West, and an art
            student in Chicago, where he lost all of his work in the Great fire of 1871. Hilliard left Indiana after
            1876 and studied and worked in Europe, primarily England, Scotland and France. Hilliard was known for his
            New England landscapes and coastal scenes, which resemble the Hudson River School in their romantic realism.
            Sometime after returning to New York from Europe Hilliard added floral subjects to his landscape work.
            Hilliard ultimately settled in Washington, D. C.   
            This small painting of roses is among the most sophisticated works produced in Indiana during the early
            1870s.  It displays Hilliard’s fluid brushwork and his subtle control of the contrast of light and dark
            tonalities.  The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of
            Japanese design.  Japanese art played a significant role in late nineteenth-century European and American

            later in his career.  He won the Prix de Rome in 1928, a scholarship for art students that provided the
            opportunity to study abroad.  Mattison spent the next three years in Europe, where he was a fellow at the
            American Academy in Rome.  After his fellowship ended, Mattison moved back to America where he taught at New
            York University, Columbia University and the New York School of Design.  In 1933, he was offered a permanent
            full-time position as the Dean of John Herron Art School in Indianapolis, where he also continued to teach. 
            Mattison’s art is rooted in the classical tradition.  He worked primarily in oil to capture the pleasant
            aspects of life, including landscapes, community celebrations, and children at play.   His 150 portraits
            included, U. S. Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sherman Minton, Indiana Governors Paul McNutt
            and Harold W. Handley, author Booth Tarkington, and the former president of the New York Stock Exchange Emil
            Schram. 
            Carnival, which should have been a lighthearted subject, is enveloped in an eerie darkness that hangs over
            the amusement park like an ominous cloud.  The man wearing a white, costume-like robe and playing a violin
            is more reminiscent of a beggar than a clown.  The viewer cannot see the faces of the two women walking
            toward the stairs and the people at the bottom of the steps are barely visible in the dim light.  Mattison
            may have intended to paint a happy event, but the uncertainties of the Depression have clearly found their
            way onto his canvas.

            Otto Stark was born in Indianapolis and apprenticed at the age of twelve to lithography.  At age sixteen, he
            studied at the Art Academy of Cincinnati and then entered the Art Students League of New York.  He later
            went to Paris where he continued his studies at the Académie Julian and became a member of the Sociéte des
            Beaux Arts et Belles Lettres.  He exhibited twice at the Paris Salon, the International Exhibition of Art
            and History in Rome and the Panama Pacific Exhibition, where he was in charge of the Indiana Exhibition. 
            For twenty years, Stark was the head of the Art Department of Emmerich Manual Training High School and an
            instructor in composition at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis. He was one of the five members
            of the Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, J. Ottis Adams, T. C.
            Steele, William Forsyth and Richard Gruelle.
            Stark took up residence in New York City, after completing his training in Paris.  When his wife died, he
            came back to his native Indiana.  A Summer Morning was painted while Stark was visiting the Hermitage, J.
            Ottis Adams’ Brookville home.  It portrays the artist’s eldest daughter Gretchen, seated in shade with her
            back to sunlit lawn, engrossed in her needlework. This solidly painted figure, posed against a loosely
            constructed landscape, exemplifies the American Impressionist style.

            Constance Coleman Richardson grew up in Irvington, Indiana, where her father was director of the Indiana
            State Historical Commission.  After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was
            anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education.  The
            compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at
            the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston
            Richardson.  After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit
            Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years.  After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar
            Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the
            Pennsylvania Academy.  During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted
            landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects.  Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling
            during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.
            Richardson’s love of the landscape is apparent in Hot Sun.  Here strong contrasts of bright sunlight
            intermingle with dark shadows, and lush green foliage. The dominant tree   is stippled with light that peaks
            through its dark leaves. Rocks and tree stumps add a rustic element to this serene landscape, while the
            houses in the distance and the young boy seated on the stone wall add a human touch.  Everything in this
            composition suggests a peaceful coexistence between people and nature.

            Indianapolis and was commissioned to paint a series of large canvases that illustrate the city’s history for
            the first Indiana exposition in 1873.  Glessing left Indianapolis in 1873 to accept a position as scenic
            painter at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.
            In 1859, at the time Glessing painted Landscape with Figures, he was in Indianapolis decorating the
            Metropolitan Theatre.  Glessing’s landscape shows the influence of Indiana artist Jacob Cox as well as
            knowledge of his English heritage.  His inclusion of figures turns this romantic landscape into a genre
            scene that is reminiscent of the Holy Family, complete with manger, mother and child, Joseph and John.

            William Merritt Chase was born in Ninevah, Indiana and studied under Barton Hayes in Indianapolis and then
            briefly at the National Academy of Design.  Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase
            was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the city’s Royal Academy.  In 1878, Chase
            returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style. 
            He was a member of America’s influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely
            influential teacher.  Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in
            Shinnecock, Long Island.  He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the
            Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.  His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley,
            Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keeffe and Charles Sheeler.
            When Chase painted this portrait of his grandfather, he was no more than eighteen years old and Moses Swaim
            just over seventy.  Young Chase had only recently begun studying with Indianapolis artist Barton Hays, but
            his likeness convincingly portrays the rugged features and earnest expression of this agricultural pioneer. 
            The tightly brushed portrait is one of Chase’s earliest canvases. It descended in the artist’s family,
            surviving a house fire and a long period in a Kansas drug store.  When it entered the IMA, the image was
            marred by soot, small holes and an improperly fitted frame.  After treatment in the museum’s laboratory and
            careful reframing, Chase’s grandfather now reveals the startlingly early prowess of his portraiture.

            Henrik Mayer was born in Nashua, New Hampshire and took his art training at the Manchester Institute of Arts
            and the Yale School of Fine Art.  He studied in Europe as a Winchester Fellow before accepting a teaching
            position in New York City where he also served as designer and decorator of the New York Cosmopolitan Club. 
            In 1934, Mayer moved to Indianapolis where he became assistant director under Donald Mattison at the Herron
            Art School.   During this period, Mayer exhibited his paintings at the Hoosier Salon, Herron Art Institute,
            Art Institute of Chicago, Corcoran Gallery Biennial, and the National Academy of Design where he won a
            prize.  He also accepted mural commissions at such places as the post office building in Lafayette,
            Indiana.  In 1946, Mayer moved to Essex, Connecticut, where he became director of the Hartford Art School of
            the Wadsworth Athenaeum. He later became dean of the Art School of the University of Harford in Connecticut
            and also served as director of the Wadsworth Athenaeum. 
            The depression-era mural projects of the Works Progress Administration probably influenced Mayer’s choice of
            grand-scale designs, and although he may never have intended Halloween Carnival to become a mural, it looks
            as if it could be a section of an enormous panorama of Halloween revelers.  According to the artist’s wife,
            Mayer’s painting was inspired by Halloween celebrations that were once held on Monument Circle in downtown
            Indianapolis.

            received was a picture of a heifer named “Gypsy Girl III” for which he was paid five dollars.  In 1904 Adams
            began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying
            under William Forsyth.  In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in

            energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images.  Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects
            included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses,
            military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors.  “At one point in his career,
            Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia.  During the winter he traveled
            extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects. 
            The Art Jury, which depicts T C. Steele, Otto, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and William Forsyth, the Hoosier Group
            artists who were Adams’ first teachers in Indiana, exemplifies the Adams’ group portraits.  This realistic
            view of his mentors shows them judging works of art.  Each portrait is carefully constructed to express the
            artists’ personalities, demeanor and facial features.  The portrait even shows Forsyth smoking, Stark with a
            cane and the signature beards worn by the men.  It is one of the few group images of the members of the
            Hoosier Group that depicts their likenesses with such accuracy. The only missing member, Richard Gruelle,
            died before the work was painted.
            The Indianapolis Museum of Art has more than fifty works by Wayman Adams in its American collection.  Many
            of these are portraits of famous Indiana residents. Included in this group are the author Booth Tarkington,
            the poet James Whitcomb Riley, the pharmaceutical giant, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr., the artist Randolph Coats and
            the local art dealer Carl Herman Lieber.

            Jacob Dunn, a native of Indiana and the son of a state treasurer, decided to enter the Indianapolis studio
            of Jacob Cox in 1840.  After a short period of art training, he took up medicine and received a degree from
            a college in Cincinnati.  Other than his appointment as an assistant surgeon in the Mexican Ware, it is not
            known to what extent Dunn practiced medicine.  He was listed among the painters of Indianapolis in the
            spring of 1851.  During the first few months Jacob Cox was in Cincinnati he and Dunn had a studio together. 
            Dunn, whose early death Jacob Cox attributed to excessive drinking, ironically chose the Temperance Pledge
            as the subject for this painting.  It represents a man who hesitates before signing the pledge, while his
            wife encourages him and the devil offers him a glass of liquor.  The man’s mended coat and frayed collar and
            shirt make his poverty painfully obvious, while the redness of his face suggests that what little money he
            did have was being spent on liquor.

            Samuel Richards was born in Owen County, Indiana and received his rudimentary art education and early
            employment in the Indianapolis photography studio of Theobald Leitz.  While there he produced portraits that
            combined photography, drawing and painting.  Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that
            time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in
            Franklin, Indiana.  He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper
            illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among
            his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures.  Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to
            attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local
            models.  Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munich’s Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana
            patrons.  While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States,
            where he took up residence in Colorado.  His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of
            forty-three.
            Richards completed his training at the Royal Academy in 1887, but unlike the other Hoosier artists, he
            showed no interest in landscape painting or any inclination to return to Indiana in the near future. 
            Instead, he entered the mainstream of professional figure painting in Munich.  This portrait, presumed to be
            the artist’s Munich-born daughter Gretchen, epitomizes all the richness of detail and formality associated
            with Munich realism.  Gretchen is posed in profile against an unadorned background.  Her hair and facial
            features are executed with exquisite detail.  Richards’ use of dark tonalities is in keeping with his Munich
            training, but the delicate pink scarf relieves the starkness of the composition.

            Hopper painted Blue Monday the same year he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Herron.  The

            in a rural community at the end of the Depression. Hopper’s use of color powerfully evokes the harsh quality
            of the scene.  A pale, dead yellow covers the dried grass and weathered buildings, shadows are painted in
            the brown color of used motor oil, and the sky is a smear of smoky tones.  Echoing the blank faces of the

            Joseph Mason was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and attended John James Audubon’s classes in drawing in
            Cincinnati.  He traveled with Audubon on a flatboat to New Orleans and drew at least fifty flowers for
            Audubon’s bird paintings.  Upon his return to Cincinnati and without further training, Mason became a
            portrait artist.  In 1834, he left Cincinnati and painted portraits in Michigan and Indiana.  He died of
            pneumonia at age thirty-four.
            The portrait of Marie Jane Andrew, age, 7, was commissioned in memory of the girl soon after she died.  She
            is dressed in an elaborate early Victorian costume and seated among the objects of her childhood; a sewing
            box, school books, treasured sea shells, and a Staffordshire pottery figure of a dog.  In addition to
            offering a wealth of information about the decorative arts of the period, this portrait is an excellent
            example of a self-trained professional portrait artist working in the nineteenth century.  Mason had
            difficulty rendering such simple objects as a book, a table top, and a chair in proper perspective.  The
            little girl’s extremities, too, are less than convincing.  The artist’s sense of composition and design
            makes up for any shortcomings in technique.  The piping on the child’s dress creates an interesting play of
            lines with the gold chain about her neck; the window encasements direct the viewer’s eye to her head, the
            focal point of the picture.  The portrait is an interesting example of a picture within a picture.  The
            painting of a boy in the upper left is believed to be the girl’s brother, James, who had also died very
            young.  The distant landscape, seen from the window, is probably their familyl home.

            John Washington Love arrived in Indianapolis with his parents when he was ten years old.  After studying in
            the public schools and Northwestern Christian University, Love decided to become an artist.  He entered the
            studio of Barton Hays and later went to Cincinnati to continue his studies.  After a year he went to New
            York and entered the School of the National Academy of Design.  He then traveled to Paris and was the first
            Indiana artist to enter the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Atélier Gérôme where he studied for four years. 
            After six years of European study, Love return to Indianapolis and set up the first Indiana School of Art
            with fellow artist James F. Gookins. Love’s promising career was cut short with his death at the age of
            thirty.
            Love’s study of a young boy shows a looser brushwork and more spontaneous approach than that of earlier
            figure paintings.  Love’s casual, informal treatment is particularly apparent in the boy’s sidelong glance. 
            His white collar bring our his facial features that would otherwise be lost in the dark background.

            Joseph Oriel Eaton was born in Newark, Ohio.  At the age of sixteen he traveled to Indianapolis and entered
            the studio of Jacob Cox.  He moved to Cincinnati and then took a trip to Europe and finally settled in New
            York, where he set up his own studio. During his time in Cincinnati Eaton became a very popular portrait
            artist.  In New York he developed a reputation as a skillful painter of women’s portraits.  When William
            Merritt Chase arrived in New York, he was referred to Eaton for assistance in pursuit of his art career. 
            Eaton was an associate member of the National Academy of design and a member of the Water Color Society and
            Artists’ Fund Society.  Although he painted landscapes and a few neoclassical pieces, Eaton is best known
            for his portraits and his free brushwork and sensitive approach.
            In the Portrait of Amelia Studley Eaton’s brushstroke appears loose, but the drawing of the sitter’s face
            remains firm and solid.  He emphasizes the sitter’s facial features by placing her against a plain
            background frames her through the use of a curtain and the fabric on the back of her chair. To move the
            viewer around the canvases he repeats the red of the curtain in the woman’s dress and the cloth behind her. 
            These techniques were used by many successful nineteenth century portrait painters.

            Cecil Head was born near Lebanon, Indiana and graduated from the John Herron Art Institute.  He later shared
            a studio with Floyd Hopper and William Kaiser in the Old Union Trust Building on Market Street in
            Indianapolis.  The group became known as the Market Street Artists. Early in his career, Head was a
            recipient of many art awards including the J. I. Holcomb Prize from the Indianapolis Art Association and the
            Ross J. Beatty Prize from the Hoosier Salon.  He was one of the artists selected by Wilbur Peat, director of
            the John Herron Art Institute, to represent Indiana in a nationwide exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in
            Washington, D. C. After a short time constructing airplane components during World War II, Head settled into
            a dual career as a commercial artist and farmer.
            Views of railroad tracks, factories and backs of houses were common subjects for many American painters
            during the first half of the twentieth-century.  Some artists chose such subjects to portray the social
            inequities and the grim ugliness that were part of modern urban life.  Although Buildings in Winter depicts
            an alley in a working-class Indianapolis neighborhood, the artist has stated that he was more interested in
            achieving a strong composition and rich color scheme than in making a social statement.  Head organized the
            blocky, geometric shapes of the buildings into a solid triangle, implied by the convergence of the stairs on
            the left and the slope of the roofs on the right. Buildings in Winter was exhibited at the 1939 New York
            World’s Fair.

            Barton Hays was raised in a religious home in Ohio that had only one book containing pictures.  Hays drew on
            barn walls with charcoal and saw his first oil painting at age twenty.  He moved to northern Indiana, where
            after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living. 
            In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm.  He tinted
            photographs and painted over enlarged prints.  Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among
            his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase.  Much of his renown came from his ability
            to convince Chase’s father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.  Hays was successful
            in receiving the commission to paint governor William Harrison’s portrait.  He was one of the original
            members of the Art Association of Indianapolis, the founders of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.
            Although Hays is best known for his portraits he also excelled at still life painting. Strawberries
            exemplifies the artist’s use of strong contrasts of light and dark to enhance the fruit.  He often
            incorporated a basket from which the strawberries spilled.  The texture of the berry and the delicacy of its
            leaves are superbly captured by Hays who used his  skill to create a realistic image of this lush fruit.

            T. C. Steele was born in Gosport Indiana.  His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art
            classes at age twelve.  By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland
            Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who
            became his patron.  He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love.  Lieber raised the
            funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive
            than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter.  When Steele returned to
            Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth.  He did portraits and landscapes, many of
            them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School.  When he began to explore the Indiana
            countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and
            gradually more impressionistic.  Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists
            known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indiana’s most important Impressionist painters, including
            William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle.  In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the
            American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco.  In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home
            that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.
            Schliersee, a resort tucked into the Alps thirty-eight rail miles southeast of Munich, was a favorite
            vacation spot for the Steele family.  From the shores of Schliersee Lake, Steele depicts the picturesque
            quality of the town.  Framed by sea and sky, the landscape of farms, cottages and churches is echoed in the
            water’s reflections.  The boat placed to the left of the village provides the necessary balance to complete
            the carefully constructed composition.
