Rowles assisted Sims in coming up with obsurities to interpret, and this recording is highlighted by such little-performed songs as  If I'm Lucky, Shadow Waltz, Gypsy Sweetheart and I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone.  The lead voices are backed ably by bassist George Mraz and drummer Mousey Alexander on this enjoyable straight-ahead date.--Scott Yanow"
