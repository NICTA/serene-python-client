92.GA.83,Hans von Aachen,1587,"A diagonal line follows the diminishing figures, from the looming body of the good thief at the extreme left edge, to Christ hanging on the cross in the center, to the bad thief at the right, and finally down toward Jerusalem, lightly sketched in the distance. A tumultuous group of figures and horses crowds around the feet of Jesus at the left, with rearing horses, the Virgin weeping, and Saint John pointing at himself; but the top left of the composition remains open. With such techniques, Hans von Aachen created an effect of dramatic spaciousness.Von Aachen probably made this large and impressive drawing as a preliminary study for a painting. He first sketched the composition extensively in black chalk, which is particularly visible in the torso and hand of the thief in the upper left corner and in the city of Jerusalem in the lower right. Next he laid in the figure groups in graywash, making extensive use of the white paper for highlights; finally, he worked over the entire composition, defining elements with relatively sparing touches of pen and brown ink.",13 1/8 x 18 1/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00040301.jpg,German,"Pen and brown ink, graywash, and black chalk underdrawing",The Crucifixion

2002.37.14,Eugène Atget,1926 ,"Late in his life, Eugène Atget made many photographs in a public park that overlooked the river Seine on the outskirts of Paris. The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal château, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones.

86.AE.230,Aegisthus Painter,470 ,"As the first of his twelve Labors, the Greek heroHerakleshad to slay theNemean Lion, a monstrous beast with an impenetrable hide that was ravaging the countryside around the city of Nemea. Since weapons were of no use against the creature, Herakles' only option was to strangle it. Herakles battling the Nemean Lion was the most frequently depicted mythological scene in Greek art. In early depictions, Herakles stands facing the lion, but by the late 500s B.C., the combatants were depicted down on the ground, stretched out in opposite directions.On this Athenianred-figurekalpis, a tree bends over Herakles and the lion, a rare example of landscape elements in Greek art. Throughout theArchaicperiod and into the earlyClassical, vase-painters focused so completely on the figures in theirnarrativescenes that they excluded almost all background elements. Scenes played out in a sort of visual vacuum without any setting at all. On this vase, for example, the tree serves only as a marker to indicate that the action takes place outdoors.The kalpis is the rounded form of ahydria, or water vessel, favored by red-figure artists in this period.

As was typical in the work of the Affecter, the figures, both dancers and observers, gesticulate strongly, but there is little meaning in their gestures. For all the apparent activity, the figures are quite passive. The Affecter put so little emphasis on thenarrativecontent of his work that scholars often have difficulty determining precisely what is being depicted. For example, some scholars interpret the figures on the back of the vase as dancing, while others see a scene of courtship. Nonetheless, all the figures are beautifully drawn with dramatic silhouettes emphasized by long angular limbs. This vase stands outside the normal stylistic trends for Athens and was probably designed for export to Etruria.

On the back of the vase, Theseus battles the Minotaur. The Affecter depicted the two great heroes of the Greeks, Herakles and Theseus, battling monsters, symbolic victories of Greek civilization over the barbarians, yet he did not appear very interested in the stories. For example, in Greek mythology, Herakles battles two centaurs, Pholos and Nessos.The depiction on this vase is quite unusual for Athenian pottery of the time, because the Affecter did not provide the clues that would identify which encounter was represented here. It is, however, quite typical for the Affecter, who focused primarily on the decorative aspects of figures. His unusual approach to potting is also evident on this vase, where he threw an old-fashioned neck-amphora form but modified it by adding a raised ring to separate the neck from the body. The oddness of the Affecter's style may be explained by the fact that he appears to have been creating vases for export to Etruria.

86.AE.324,Akestorides Painter,470 - 450 ,"By the early 400s B.C., professional teachers had established schools in Athens. These teachers, who specialized in various aspects of education, provided training for the male children of parents who could afford to pay the tuition. The most basic education in one of these schools would have involved reading and writing and perhaps arithmetic. At about the same time, scenes of youths at school learning their lessons began to appear on Athenian vases, part of a growing interest on the part of vase-painters in depicting scenes of daily life.This smallred-figurecup fragment shows a boy holding a scroll while another person, perhaps his teacher, stands in front of him. Scholars have disagreed over what the scroll says. Some read it as the beginning of a list of mythological figures. Others see it as a fragment from an epic poem by Hesiod, ""The Catalog of Women."" The latter interpretation may be more accurate since all other scrolls in school scenes contain epic poetry.

The series illustrates the Biblical story of Dives and Lazarus from the Book of Luke. Lazarus, a pauper, lived outside the gates of Dives's afluent home. While Dives lived in luxury, Lazarus lived off the crumbs from his table. When the two died, Lazarus was taken to heaven, while Dives went to hell. Dives was punished for eternity because of his mistreatment of Lazarus on earth.Although the story takes place in the early Christian era, Aldegrever placed the figures in a fashionable interior of the 1500s. Artists often chose to use contemporary settings to make it easier for their viewers to identify with the characters. Dives's feast takes place in a sumptuous interior decorated with bottle glass windows. On the floor, glass vessels fill a wine cooler.

Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round.

In the background, Neptune, ruler of the sea, brandishes his trident and rides in a shell chariot drawn by two hippocamps (sea horses).In this drawing, Alessandro Algardi combined idealization of the human body derived from classical sculpture with convincing, realistic representation based on close observation of the human form. His energetic use of chalk imbued the scene with movement and caught the effect of light, particularly in his modeling of Venus's soft skin and the tritons' muscular flesh.Algardi most often made drawings in association with sculptural projects. As the master of the illusionistic pictorial relief during the Baroque era in Rome, he may have designed this arrangement of figures for a low-relief sculpture, possibly for execution in embossed metalwork.

At the bottom of the stack is Maurice Raynal's 1922 monograph on Picasso, a foundational text that greatly influenced Alvarez Bravo. Picasso's work encouraged the artist to experiment with abstract and cubist compositions. The viewer can only speculate about the contents of the books stacked on top of the monograph, but it is likely that these volumes were equally important to Alvarez Bravo's development as a photographer.This formal, abstract image indicates that, by 1930, Alvarez Bravo had absorbed many contemporary modernist ideas, even though he lived in Mexico City, far from the main centers of avant-garde artistic production.

Although vase-painters in the closing years of the 500s B.C. began to show an interest in the setting of their scenes, the depiction of battle in an architectural setting is very rare in Greek art.

A lamppost appears to be up for sale alongside a mantel clock; a wagon wheel is displayed just under a cherub to the right of the vases.

The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones.

It is the period when subconsciously the human joins with nature's forces, and lives as a tree, a flower, or an insect.--Saul BaizermanThis reclining female figure suggests stillness and movement, fragility and strength. The oversized nude conveys mass and weight, but it is in fact a slender sheet of hammered copper supported by an iron armature. The substantial presence of the form is also undermined by the marked absence of head and neck, arms and feet. Finally, the textured, irregular copper surface, an indelible record of the artist's hammering, also animates the figure's sensual curving form.Saul Baizerman executed a pair of large female nudes entitled Night and Day.

After Valori's death, the collection remained intact, becoming part of the Uffizi Gallery's collection in 1866. Baldinucci also made duplicates for his own collection. These duplicate drawings, unbound from the book in which he collected them, were dispersed at London sales in the 1760s. Scholars are uncertain about the identity of this sitter. Theversodisplays an accidental offset from another portrait drawing, most likely by Baldinucci, which suggests that this drawing probably came from his book of duplicates.

The railroad, traveling at three times the speed of a horse and carriage, was a unifying element in France, literally and figuratively bridging the country's various regions and promoting an unprecedented sense of nationhood.Like other photographers working in the 1800s, Édouard Baldus used long exposure times to make his photographs. If an individual or a carriage moved away from its initial position, a faint impression was captured on the negative and appeared in the print.

An account of Peisistratos's return from exile, in fact, describes how he had a woman dressed as Athena ride in the chariot with him. This vase was broken and extensively repaired inantiquity.

He left the kneeling figure of Saint Mary Magdalene unfinished in the right foreground, though she appears in a similar pose and position in the later, more colorful oil sketch and the finished painting.Barocci commonly used an elaborate preparatory method for planning his pictures.

84.XO.968.5,Hippolyte Bayard,1842,"This image is an early example of a scientific fundamental of photography--the light sensitive nature of certain chemical compounds. Without the use of a camera or lens, Hippolyte Bayard carefully arranged a delicate selection of laces and flora on a sheet of paper that was made sensitive to light with a combination of iron salts that produced a blue-tonedcyanotypewhen developed. The sheet of sensitized paper with the objects placed upon it is exposed to sunlight in order to make a camera-lessphotogenic drawing.The opacity of the object blocks the light in relation to its density, thus creating a silhouette of the object on the paper. Because the process was relatively uncomplicated, cyanotypes provided a quick method of recording easily recognizable shapes and patterns. Bayard filled the entire sheet of paper, creating a catalog of specimens that reveals the basic structure of each flower, leaf, feather, and scrap of fabric.",10 15/16 x 8 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/07138501.jpg,French,Direct positive print,Arrangement of Specimens

These graphical forms support the photograph's gridlikecomposition, which seems curiously at odds with its gentle framing. The oval mask may have been an attempt to soften the subject's starkness, following a fine-art approach adopted by photographers in the 1800s.Bayard made many views of Paris in the early years following photography's invention, favoring the British-inventedcalotypeprocess over France'sdaguerreotypeprocess.

The manufactory turned to artist François Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.",H:  11 ft. x W:  8 ft. 9 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/27805101.jpg,French,Silk and wool,Tapestries: The Story of Psyche

But what you call ""architecture"" is probably designed architecture, and we were both interested in that difference. The principle ""form follows function"" is rather not in architecture but in industrial buildings.--Hilla BecherIn the early twentieth century, engineering teams rather than individual architects took a strictly ""form-follows-function"" approach to the industrial buildings they designed throughout Western Europe. These nine examples of water towers in France and Germany exemplify that philosophy. The cylindrical shape of a water tower, for example, reflects its primary function as a storage vessel. Because water towers are concentric and symmetrical, they present one of the simpler types of industrial building that can be described in a single view. As Hilla Becher has explained, ""Some objects don't need different views.""In this grid of nine images of water towers, the artists encourage viewers to participate in a playful game of examining forms and their details. This comparative analysis of types is a fundamental aspect of their work, from basic form as a reflection of function, to details and material as a reflection of regional styles or late modifications. The Bechers came to refer to arrangments like this as ""typologies."" The typology occurs in two forms in their work: organized in more traditional linear sequences, usually in books; or--as exemplified here--arranged in grids to encourage comparisons based on horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacencies.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31261301.jpg,German,Gelatin silver prints,"Water Towers, France and Germany"

84.XM.125.61-69,Bernd and Hilla Becher,1968 - 1972,"We were interested in architecture. But what you call ""architecture"" is probably designed architecture, and we were both interested in that difference. The principle ""form follows function"" is rather not in architecture but in industrial buildings.--Hilla BecherIn the early twentieth century, engineering teams rather than individual architects took a strictly ""form-follows-function"" approach to the industrial buildings they designed throughout Western Europe. These nine examples of water towers in France and Germany exemplify that philosophy. The cylindrical shape of a water tower, for example, reflects its primary function as a storage vessel. Because water towers are concentric and symmetrical, they present one of the simpler types of industrial building that can be described in a single view. As Hilla Becher has explained, ""Some objects don't need different views.""In this grid of nine images of water towers, the artists encourage viewers to participate in a playful game of examining forms and their details. This comparative analysis of types is a fundamental aspect of their work, from basic form as a reflection of function, to details and material as a reflection of regional styles or late modifications. The Bechers came to refer to arrangments like this as ""typologies."" The typology occurs in two forms in their work: organized in more traditional linear sequences, usually in books; or--as exemplified here--arranged in grids to encourage comparisons based on horizontal, vertical, and diagonal adjacencies.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31261301.jpg,German,Gelatin silver prints,"Water Towers, France and Germany"

MS.

Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion.

A hefty cow tentatively dips its front hooves into the water. The hatted herdsman brings up the rear with a long stick in his hand. The group's movement is anchored around a pair of large trees that cross at the center of the composition.Nicolaes Berchem liberally applied brown wash to the figures, animals, and central trees. Pools of wash in the foreground water evoke cast shadows. Behind the group, layers of gray wash contrast with the white paper to convey raking, midday sunlight. On top of the gray wash, Berchem's sketchy use of pen and brown ink suggest slightly rugged foliage.During the mid-1600s, Berchem was one of the most popular Dutch artists working in anItalianatestyle. This drawing does not feature any typical Italianmotifs, like columns or ruins, but the sun-drenched scene suggests an idyllic Mediterranean setting. In the century after Berchem's death, collectors across Europe sought out these pastoral views.

Two huntsmen converse with a hostess-- perhaps regaling her with tales from the day's chase. On the balcony above, a washerwoman sets out laundry. At left, partly shrouded in shade, a woman serves two seated men. Above this trio, two pairs of tiny figures explore the upper reaches of the towering ruin behind the inn.Nicolaes Berchem is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. In these panoramic paintings, figures generally play a secondary role. By contrast, inThe Return From the Hunt, Berchem focused on the interaction between figures and architectural setting rather than the landscape. The unusual vertical format showcases the artist's command of light. Light falling on the mounted horseman also illuminates the woman on the balcony as well as the figures on the left.Hunters at rest was a popular subject among northern genre painters in the 1600s.

At the base of the image, Berents adds his signature, and a reference to his unusual dual career as a mathematician.This work is part of a long tradition of Dutch genre scenes. In particular, Berents' detailed landscape evokes those by an earlier Netherlandish artist, Pieter Bruegel. Much like Bruegel's figures, Berents' skaters have a somewhat comical air about them due to the extra long blades on their ice skates.

Even at this young age, Bernini was such a skilled marble sculptor that he could differentiate the textures of pudgy flesh, soft hair, waves of water, and dragon scales. A hole in the dragon's mouth shows that the sculpture was used as a fountain.The infant Hercules, who demonstrated his divine strength even as an infant by slaying poisonous serpents, appears here as a mischievous boy who smiles, sits on the dragon, and breaks its jaw with his bare hands. Common in Hellenistic statuary, the theme of Hercules and the serpent was revived in sculpture of the early 1600s. Bernini probably based the composition of his work on an antique work, but contemporary concerns also played a role. He may have represented the serpent as a dragon because his patron, Barberini, wished to convey a satirical message about another important Roman patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, whose family coat of arms included a dragon.",22 x 20 1/2 x 16 5/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00135801.jpg,Italian,Marble,Boy with a Dragon

His unruly hair and beard and the billowing drapery that winds around his muscled figure evoke the sense of a whipping wind over the ocean. The flattened planes with which the sculptor modeled the muscles on the chest, arms, and legs heighten the feel of strength in the figure's movements. His intense focus on an unseen object before him adds a menacing tone. This drama of physicality and motion is characteristic of the Baroque style.The tabletop bronze is a reduced variant of a marble fountain sculpture made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini around 1620 for the garden of the great collector and patron, Cardinal Montalto, in Rome. All of the four known versions in bronze include a long-bodied dolphin between Neptune's legs, replacing the figure of a triton who served as a supportive strut on the marble statue. Reductions in bronze are unusual in Roman sculpture of the time; the multiple reproductions of Neptune are probably due to the celebrity of its maker, who dominated Roman sculptural production in the seventeenth century.",H: 22 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00147001.jpg,Italian,Bronze,Neptune and Dolphin

By depicting the man gazing directly out with boldness and animation, Bernini created an active exchange between sitter and viewer, just as he did in his sculpture.Bernini rarely used red chalk without black.

Gian Lorenzo Bernini swiftly outlined the shapes of the rock formations as well as the marine god and dolphin. Using some blunt tool, perhaps even a thumb or finger, he softly smudged the lines to create the shadows that form the contorted pose of the god's muscular torso. Between 1652 and 1653, Bernini sent studies for fountains to Duke Francesco I d'Este for his palace.

A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio.

The manufactory turned to artist François Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back.

Enraged with jealously,Hera, Zeus's wife, changed Kallisto into a bear. On this chous, Kallisto already has the animal's pointed ears, hairy arms, and paws. She wears hunting boots and her hunting spears are propped against the rock at the left.Moving to the right on the jug, baby Arkas sits on the ground but is being pulled into the arms ofHermes, the messenger god. Hermes wears his traditional costume of a traveling hat and cloak. His special wand, the kerykeion, rests against a stone marker behind him. Hermes is going to transport the soon-to-be-orphaned baby to his own mother, Maia, who will raise Arkas on Mount Kyllene in Arcadia.In one version of the myth, Arkas later joins his mother Kallisto among the stars as parts of the constellations of the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper.",6 5/8 x 3 5/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00806901.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,"Wine Jug with Arkas and His Mother, Kallisto, and the God Hermes"

The uneven, fibrous, opaque color of the ground under Eve distinguishes this area as printed, while the even sweep of the red washes shows that the flames behind Satan are mostly watercolor, a medium William Blake often used because he liked its transparent quality.Blake's images reflected his own very personal visions, which he insisted were ""not a cloudy vapour or a nothing; they are organized and minutely articulated beyond all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce."" The twelve large, color-printed drawings that he created in 1795 rank among his most complex works. To achieve the effects he envisioned, poet-painter Blake invented an innovative three-step process: 1) drawing the image with thick, sticky watercolors on a piece of stiff paper board; 2) stamping the sticky image on paper; and 3) working over the resulting print in watercolor washes and pen and ink.

In most depictions of this myth, a favorite among Greek artists in the 600s and early 500s B.C., Bellerophon rides Pegasos, his winged horse, but here he has dismounted, still holding the reins. While Pegasos strikes at the Chimaera with his hooves, Bellerophon spears the monster from underneath.The unique, symmetrical arrangement of the rearing horse and monster framing the hero is the result of the artist's attempt to find creative ways to fill the circular area of the interior of a cup. Three ornamental bands and palmettes at the handles decorate the cup's exterior.Lakonian vase-painters specialized in the decoration of cups; this example, with its high foot and slanting rim, fits the typical form.

Various types of flowers that would not bloom in the same season appear together here: roses, forget-me-nots, lilies-of-the-valley, a cyclamen, a violet, a hyacinth, and tulips. Rendering meticulous detail, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder conveyed the silky texture of the petals, the prickliness of the rose thorns, and the fragility of opening buds. Insects crawl, alight, or perch on the bouquet. Each is carefully described and observed, from the dragonfly's transparent wings to the butterfly's minutely painted antennae. Although a vague reference, insects, short-lived like flowers, are a reminder of the brevity of life and the transience of its beauty.A rising interest in botany and a passion for flowers led to an increase in painted floral still lifes at the end of the 1500s in both the Netherlands and Germany.

N20060426.1,Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory,1741 - 1750,"In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist François Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.",H:  11 ft. x W:  8 ft. 9 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/27805101.jpg,French,Silk and wool,Tapestries: The Story of Psyche

At her feet, a pair of naiads, or water nymphs, presents red coral and other sea treasures to the goddess of love. Two tritons, semi-human sea dwellers, vigorously vie for Venus's attention. One triton blows on his shell-trumpet while the other, wedged between his partner and a fantastical dolphin, empties water out of his horn. In both sea and sky, putti pay tribute to the goddess. Amid all this attention, Venus remains impassive, decidedly detached from the churning sea.François Boucher's immense popularity in eighteenth-century Europe was matched by his versatility; he created everything from cabinet paintings to tapestry and stage designs. But this drawing is one of only three known gouaches by Boucher. In this work, the painter loosely applied the media--his handling varying from the expressive, almost chaotic, energy of the sea to the delicate, linear touch applied to Venus and her female attendants. Given its large size and ambitious composition, the gouache was probably created as an independent work of art and not as a study for a painting. Boucher frequently depicted this goddess, and the gouache bears a striking resemblance to hisVenus on the Waves, a later oil painting also in the Getty's collection.",15 3/8 x 12 3/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/25865101.jpg,French,Black chalk and gouache,The Birth and Triumph of Venus

We seem to peer over her shoulder at the scene of the presentation of her infant son at the altar of the priest Simeon. The purpose of compositions such as this one--which were increasingly popular in the second half of the 1400s--was to bring viewers physically closer to the narrative and actively engage them in the event being portrayed.The Hours of Louis XII, so-called after its patron King Louis XII of France, was one of the greatest French manuscripts of its time. Only sixteen of the manuscript's original complement of miniatures have come to light, and the Getty has acquired three of them.

Gabriel, dressed in white with multi-colored wings, kneels and points towards the circular window above, indicating the presence of God. With his other hand he draws back the curtain of the canopy.Dieric Bouts painted the scene in a lucid and spatially convincing setting. The room at the left is simply described: a barrel ceiling, a marble column with two steps leading up to the room, and a stained glass window. A mood of solemnity, suitable for prayer, pervades the scene. In this somber setting Bouts's use of bright red for the drapery seems unusual. It may signify the Passion, forecasting the death of Christ, or it may be purely decorative since Bouts used this color in other compositions.The Annunciationbelongs to a set of five paintings that originally constituted a polyptych representing scenes from the life of Jesus Christ.

Earlier window designs of tournament scenes divided the jouster, heralds, and jester into separate quatrefoils. Breu abandoned this Gothic format to create a unified scene embellished with architectural and genre details.

Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia.

God instructed Noah to build an ark and to take on board a male and a female of every species of bird and beast.In 1609 Brueghel was appointedcourt paintertoArchduke Albertand theInfanta Isabella, who had collected exotic and unusual animals from across the world, creating a menagerie in Brussels. Brueghel studied and drew many of these animals from life. With the discovery of the New World in the 1600s came an increased curiosity about natural history. This interest led many European rulers, who had in the past collected stuffed animals, shells, and other natural objects, to form menageries of rare live animals.",21 1/2 x 33 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00103401.jpg,Flemish,Oil on panel,The Entry of the Animals into Noah's Ark

The fish flowing from the water jug and the cornucopia of abundance cradled in the arms of the figure on the right correspond to the tactile elements of water and earth. The birds in the sky and trees and the accoutrements of battle in the foreground correspond to the intangible elements of fire and air. The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape.Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers.

Several dozen vases with similarly dressed revelers survive. Scholars call these scenes of men in fancy dress Anakreontic, after the poet Anakreon, who came to Athens from East Greece in the late 500s B.C. Scholars do not agree on how to interpret this costume. Because the men's clothing is similar to that of the women in the scene, some scholars see the men as transvestites dressing up as women. Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C.

Cameron probably directed this gesture, which adds great emotional impact.Family was the cornerstone of Cameron's art and life. This and other photographs of the Normans represent a bonding among the remaining family. Making the series may have helped Cameron cope with her sense of loss. It was Charles and Julia Norman's gift of a camera that became the catalyst for her photography.

He then arranged combinations of putti, human figures, trailing foliage, and bucrania around each form.Artists designed such intricate candelabra not just as functional objects like candle or torch supports; they also appeared as decorative motifs. Such forms ornamented the margins of printed books and filled the edges of frescoes. Parallel hatched lines down the sides of each candelabrum in this drawing give each form a sense of depth. But the clarity of the lines also suggests that the drawings could have transferred for engravings.

White-chalk highlights create the illusion that parts of the body project forward in space, adding a sense of three-dimensionality. Red chalk on Christ's hands and feet creates further naturalistic details by suggesting flesh tones.Although Carreño's rough drawing style is distinctly Spanish, the combination of charcoal and red and white chalk reflects the strong influence of Renaissance Venetian art on seventeenth-century Spanish artists.

Using simple broad monumental forms for the body, he expressed Dumas's artistic power as an almost physical force. In contrast to the large planes of the coat and limbs, the sculptor crisply defined the facial features and hair with a sharp tool. Since Dumas had died over thirteen years earlier, Carrier-Belleuse derived the facial features from an earlier marble portraitbust, made by another artist and exhibited in 1876.",H:  31 3/4 x W:  11 x D:  10 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00146401.jpg,French,Terracotta,Model for a Monument to Alexandre Dumas père

The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Sèvres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the répareur, Étienne-Henry Bono.

Instead, he limited the figure's goat-like features to the face, which displays protruding horns and a savage, animal-like expression that Cellini described as ""fiery and menacing, instilling fear into the beholders."" Cellini designed this and a similar figure to flank the monumental entrance of Porte Dorée, the royal palace atFontainebleau.

Although the Salon refused him admission, Cézanne continued to paint many portraits of his friend, including the present example, thought to have been painted around 1869 to 1871.For this painting, Cézanne used a palette knife rather than brushes. With the spatula-like instrument, he applied paint in thick, successive layers, giving the surface a complex, rough-and-smooth texture. He then used the knife to squeeze the paints together so that they mixed directly on the canvas. In this fashion Cézanne moved the paint around, eliminating contour lines and instead creating impastoed areas of color, as if sculpting in paint. In another portrait of his friend made four years earlier, the coarse, almost violent appearance created by Cézanne's technique led Valabrègue to complain in a letter to the writer Zola: ""He has given me such a fierce complexion that it reminds me of the statue of Champfleury when it was stained with squashed blackberries.""",23 5/8 x 19 3/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00087701.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,Portrait of Anthony Valabrègue

96.PA.8,Paul Cézanne,1893 - 1894,"During the last thirty years of his life, Paul Cézanne painted the same objects--the green vase, the rum bottle, the ginger pot, and the apples--over and over again. His interest was not in the objects themselves but in using them to experiment with shape, color, and lighting. He arranged his still lifes so that everything locked together. Edges of objects run into each other; for example, a black arabesque seemingly escapes from the blue cloth to capture an apple in the center; the sinuous curves of the blue ginger pot's rattan straps merge with other straps on the body of the bottle behind. Giving form and mass to objects through the juxtaposition of brushstrokes and carefully balanced colors and textures, he gave the painting a sense of comforting stability.",25 3/4 x 32 1/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/10932501.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,Still Life with Apples

Since theRenaissance, artists have used this pose to portray melancholy. The pose, combined with her hauntingly unreadable face, gives a human poignancy and psychological tension to the figure.Juxtaposing bold, individual strokes of color, Paul Cézanne built up the woman's powerful physical presence and the space she occupies. As a twentieth-century painter and admirer of Cézanne observed, his later works, such asYoung Italian Womanhave ""an enormous sense of volume, breathing, pulsating, expanding, contracting, through his use of colors."" While the woman's form is convincing, the space behind and around her can appear contradictory and even confusing. How far away is the wall? Is the tabletop flat underneath the cloth? Does she sit or stand? These questions give tension and movement to an otherwise stablecomposition.From the 1890s until the end of his life, Cézanne painted a number of these grand figure studies, usually relying upon local workers or residents for his models.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13609401.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,Young Italian Woman at a Table
83.GC.221,Paul Cézanne,1900,"The still life was a principal theme throughout Paul Cézanne's artistic career. Using a repertoire of everyday objects such as fruit, jugs, bottles, and plates, he experimented with relationships of form, color, and pattern. Although the groupings seem casual, Cézanne is known to have taken great care with the arrangement, sometimes spending hours positioning the objects.In this brightly colored watercolor, Cézanne's monumental conception of form is evident: the jug, the two pots, one white, one blue, and the seven apples assume a physical presence beyond normal perception of their existence. Using small patches of color laid next to one another, Cézanne evoked the plasticity of substance, building form rather like bricks build structures. His fresh and vigorous brushstrokes are visible against the background wall as areas of greens and blues are juxtaposed. The apples are described with red arcs around the perimeter, then yellow brushstrokes next to the red; the empty middle suggests light reflecting off the surface. Curving brushstrokes of brown, green, and blue that seem to blend with the bottom half of the wall actually compose the tablecloth.",18 15/16 x 24 7/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00002701.jpg,French,Watercolor over graphite,Still Life with Blue Pot

He suggested the objects' various textures and substances through the play of light across surfaces and successive applications of paint.

The tyrants who ruled Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, may have adopted Herakles as their symbol; and the scene may refer to a naval victory of Athens over her neighboring enemy, the city-state of Megara.",5 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/10980301.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,Pitcher with Herakles Wrestling Triton

As was typical of the Rococo style, his works tended to be playful and erotic.Although Clodion finished the piece in the round, he designed it to be seen from the front, placed on a piece of furniture or on a mantelpiece.

Increasingly, Closson and his contemporaries of the early 1800s were painting landscapes outdoors, using not only watercolor but oil on paper. By immediately rendering his observations in paint, Closson developed his skill at reproducing nature's myriad, constantly shifting colors. He used the oil paint's thickness and saturated, opaque colors to invest the simple leaves with a powerful visual impact.The butterburr, also known as bog rhubarb, has enormous leaves, which Closson showed in varying phases, from verdant green to withered purplish-brown. At the center, a leaf is beginning to change color, midway between life and death. Closson's choice of a close viewpoint and monumental treatment of what might otherwise seem a trivial subject lead the viewer to contemplate the cyclical nature of life. This theme of the brevity of human life and the transience of earthly pleasures was often treated in still lifes and flower pictures.",13 1/2 x 24 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00048401.jpg,Belgian,Oil on paper,Large Butterburr Leaves and Grass

But that fact would never be deduced from this gleaming, orderly interior, a model of efficiency.Each identical engine aligns perfectly with the hood that draws the steam from the pipe, thus keeping the building clear of poisonous carbon monoxide fumes.

Red chalk had long been popular for drawing the human figure and for rendering pinkish-tan flesh tones because of its rosy color. By liberally laying in white chalk, Corneille created a sensuous play of light over the Christ Child's skin and described the diaphanous fabric loosely draped around the fleshy infant's body. To further heighten the brilliance of the red and white chalks, he chose blue paper as his support.

While he typically eschewedallegory, Courbet may have also followed the Dutch practice of using ephemeral flowers to suggest the transitory nature of life and human happiness.

70.PB.18,Josse van Craesbeeck,1645,"In seventeenth-centuryFlanders, paintings of peasant scenes began to take on a new character, emphasizing carousing, drinking, and smoking. The central action of this painting is a variation on the theme of cardsharks made popular by Caravaggio. Josse van Craesbeeck'sCard Playersalso shows the influence of his friend and teacher Adriaen Brouwer, who also painted sordid tavern scenes.Craesbeeck presented peasants engaged in crude, dishonest, and vulgar activities. In this disreputable game of cards, the woman decides which card to play by examining her opponent's cards, which she sees in a mirror held up behind her opponent's back by her accomplice. At the right, another woman with a broken pipe at her feet drinks wine and smokes, while a man relieves himself against the wall. A seated child wearing a kind of turban plays on the floor. The woman with the straw hat and the bearded man, colored with great refinement, are characteristic types in Craesbeeck's repertory of figures.

This drawing provided the inspiration for the lion in a laterwoodcut, although Cranach changed the coat and mane to make them more shaggy and curly.Exotic animals such as lions, tigers, and elephants were extremely rare in Europe in the 1500s. Although members of the aristocracy kept some in private zoos or menageries, artists mainly had to rely on prints or stuffed examples if they wished to include an exotic beast in their works.

2003.100,Lucas Cranach the Elder,1526,"Lucas Cranach the Elder drew from both native German andclassicalliterary sources to depict a family offaunsin a woodland clearing. Although the precise subject of this painting remains obscure, it recalls the legendary ""wild man"" found in medieval mythology, as well as idyllic forest dwellers, such as fauns, described in Greek poetry.The male faun sits on a rock, staff in hand, with a slain lion at his feet. He gazes toward a woman--presumably his wife--and their children. Dark foliage mediates between them and a stunning landscape: a lake, a village, mountains, and a castle in the distance. Isolated and protected from civilization, these figures represent the wild traits of mankind. On the other hand, the faun's humanlike appearance, the woman's calm demeanor, and the baby's tender gesture suggest more civilized aspects of society.Aside from this broadernarrative, Cranach's finely worked style draws attention to incidental elements, such as the lion's fur and a man and a horse and cart climbing the castle-topped mountain. The lion's stylized body fits perfectly in the painting's lower left corner. Such attention to detail and Cranach's complex subject matter appealed to the refined tastes of his learned, courtlypatrons.",32 5/8 x 22 1/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/24485601.jpg,German,Oil on panel,A Faun and His Family with a Slain Lion

The gleaming white highlights of the oil paint in the face contrast with the brown ground, making the sitter seem to emerge from the shadows and enhancing the illusion of his living presence; the young man's large, intelligent eyes further the effect. Cranach combined intensity of expression with jewel-like refinement of surfaces to create a memorable image.To produce the brownish ground, Cranach rubbed the paper with oil. He then sketched in the outlines of the head in pen and ink, meticulously going over the eyebrows, lashes, and outer facial contours. Next, using black chalk and brown oil paint, he sketched in the hat and collar.

He then freely applied varied washes to the legs and antlers.On the verso, a quickly brushed yet well-formed three-dimensional goat grazes energetically.

On the left, a priest walks under an umbrella, accompanied by an acolyte. Several plague-stricken figures languish on the ground in various stages of death.

Cressent was fined several times for these infringements; in order to pay the penalties, he was forced to hold sales of his stock. In a catalogue he wrote in 1756 for one such sale, he describes this commode's unique central gilt-bronze mount: ""the bronzes [represent] two children who are grating snuff; in the middle is a monkey powdering itself with snuff.""By the time it was built, this commode already looked old-fashioned. By the 1740s most commodes were constructed without a central divider that separated the two drawers. Although the curving gilt-bronze branches on the front try to mask this division, Cressent had to split the mount into three pieces--an awkward solution.

Crivelli created a visually dynamic painting by contrasting the manner of representation in the main figural group with that of the background. In contrast to the sculptural clarity of the Trinity, the golden angels' heads in the background are painted in such a manner that they are partially formed out of the expanse of blue and red space, making them spatially ambiguous and ethereal. The Trinity represents the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead according to Catholic belief.

Andrea and Orsina are attired in the richly decorated robes, tunics, capes, and gowns characteristic of Italian Renaissance courts.

Along the border and frame, he showed various options for ornamentalmotifsthat a patron could choose, such asputtiholding garlands or draped female figures, portraitmedallionsor rosettes, and scrolling. The decoration, once the ceiling was built, would have been symmetrical; this drawing allowed the artist to help the patron understand his or her choices.La Fosse used this drawing as a presentation piece for an unknown ceiling decoration project.

"MS. 69, RECTO",Antoine de Lonhy,1460,"Dressed in flowing robes of ocher and brilliant green, the monumental form of Christ dominates this leaf from a missal. The miniature prefaced the opening of the text for the Canon of the Mass, during which the priest prepares bread and wine for the Eucharist. The composition follows the traditional model for Christ in Majesty, with Christ seated on the arc of heaven and within a mandorla. He holds a chalice over which the host hovers, a reference to the celebration of the Eucharist. The stylized rays of light that emanate from Christ's form create a direct contrast to the subtle modeling of the folds of his robes and sensitively painted hands and face. The eagle, man, lion, and ox placed in the corners are symbols of the four evangelists, John, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, respectively. Each holds a scroll inscribed with the corresponding saint's name.This leaf is one of the finest paintings by Antoine de Lonhy, who was active in the Savoy region of France in the 1400s.

During his time of religious contemplation, Saint Jerome was tormented by vivid hallucinations; his right hand clasps a rock with which he would beat his breast until the visions passed. A nook in the vaulted structure behind him holds his attributes: a cardinal's hat and a book referring to his translation of the Bible into Latin. A small lion inside the shelter recalls the fable in which Jerome pulls a thorn from a lion's paw, forever securing the animal's devotion. Ercole de'Roberti was artist to the court of Ferrara in northern Italy.

The informal, extreme close-up view of Degas's face and his impassive, almost sullen expression echo the unpretentiousness of his clothing. The small-scale, informal presentation and lightness of touch emphasize the intimacy of this image and the still-tentative character of the young artist.Around 1857, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four, Degas traveled to Italy, where he spent much of his time making copies afterRenaissancemasters. The period was one of self-education and he drew prolifically, writing in one of his notebooks, ""I must thoroughly realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead.""

Posed with her head tilted and leaning against the back of her left hand, she appears weary. Her languorous expression and red-rimmed eyes, together with the limp right arm hanging at her side, suggest a physical or emotional malady, though nothing in the painting confirms the cause of her affliction. Hidden beneath a brown robe and full white gown, her pose is ambiguous; it is unclear if she sits, stands, or leans.The Convalescentattests to Degas's interest in the world of women--their physical characteristics and surroundings, and their complex emotional and psychological conditions.Unlike traditional nineteenth-century portraits, which were commissioned and usually left the artist's studio upon completion, this depiction of an unidentified woman remained in Degas's studio for at least fifteen years. The painting is unconventional in other ways as well;The Convalescentis more psychologically suggestive and spatially ambiguous than typical portraits of the time, such as Franz Xaver Winterhalter's official portrait,Leonilla, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn.Degas's thick, unblended brushstrokes and flattened space bring the figure forward, conveying informality and intimacy.",25 5/8 x 18 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/21737301.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,The Convalescent

He quickly filled this sketchbook with drawings that show his preoccupation with a variety of theatrical themes, including thecafé-concertand the ballet. When he completed the sketchbook, Degas presented it to his friend, who shared his passion for theater and music. Halévy later added inscriptions to many of the pages--a useful addition for scholars, as they distinguish Degas's contributions from those by other friends who occasionally drew in the book. Halévy inscribed the date1877and the wordsCroquis de Degas(Degas's Sketchbook) on the book's cover.During his lifetime, Degas filled thirty-eight sketchbooks, using them for a variety of purposes: recording the appearance of a work of art he admired or a person he observed, visualizing a fictional scene he had read, or experimenting with a new idea.

Her head is a simple circle, with two curved lines for eyes, a half circle for her nose, and a swirl of lines representing her tousled hair.

One woman rests her head on her hand, with a bottle and a half-empty glass beside her, her eyes closed either in exhaustion or an alcoholic stupor. The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing.

They gathered around the marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived to entertain them. One evening Edgar Degas quickly sketched the café singer Theresa singingLaChanson du Chien(The Song of the Dog), a catchy little tune in which she imitated a dog as part of her act.Caught in full song, Theresa lifts her gloved hands to imitate the forlorn begging of a dog.

The rounded curves of her back and bustle echo the upward sweep of her hair.Degas was fascinated by the play of light over forms and generally chose to show the figures in his works under artificial rather than natural light. The glowing globes behind the head of Mademoiselle Dumay emphasize the whiteness of her face and her dark hair. Degas smudged the charcoal around her breasts and arms to suggest darker areas of shadow.

Only the head and shoulders of her companion are visible as he gazes deeply into her eyes from the side of the scene. In this sharpcaricatureof a prostitute and her soldier, Edgar Degas captured with a few quick strokes the whore's deep appraising look as she sizes up her client. A few impatient lines characterize the broad, fleshy width of her shoulders and arms, the edge of her exposed breast, and her wrinkled dress. Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention. In the same year Degas sketched several drawings based on its events in his notebook. The book tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the École Militaire.

95.GD.35.18,Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas,1877,"When Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877, the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute quickly caught Edgar Degas's attention. Months later, he sketched several scenes from the book in his notebook, focusing on the episodes when the prostitute is with her soldier lover. Here the drunken pair have fallen asleep at a table with an empty wine bottle between them. Using hasty, seemingly careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures and their surroundings with a few slashing lines. The woman's slumped posture and her companion's open-mouthed sleep are both recorded in the most emphatic terms, without sacrificing either swiftness or spontaneity. Simply by smudging the pencil lines with his finger, Degas also created darker accents such as the shadows under the table, the crease of the prostitute's shoulder blades, and her black hair. This effect dissolves the body's contours and emphasizes the woman's dark form in contrast to the soldier's pale, empty figure in the background.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13370801.jpg,French,Graphite,Brothel Scene

They gathered around marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived later to entertain them. One evening Edgar Degas quickly drew three sketches of a café singer. At the left she crosses her arms at her waist, her head and legs left incomplete. In the center she bows to the right, grasping her skirt with her gloved hand; on the right she gestures at an invisible audience.Degas's quick pencil lines captured the fleshy width of her arms and chest and her simple upswept hair. Only a single zigzagging line forms the ruffled edge of her low-cut gown.

After many attempts, many bearings being taken in every direction, he has fallen in love with the modern and, in the modern, he has cast his choice upon laundresses and dancers.""In the 1870s Edgar Degas became fascinated with ballet dancers, paying frequent visits to the classes where the Opèra's ballet master, Perrot, trained groups of young girls. He used these excursions to work out new ideas for various paintings or lithographs or to rework ideas that he had used before. In this group of three quick sketches, Degas concentrated on the gestures and expressions of the ballet master and his pupil, several of which he later re-used. At the left Perrot directs the dancers as he does in a painting known asRépétition de Ballet(Ballet Practice). In the center, a tall dancer faces left with her head bent forward.

Towering over the much smaller male figure, the singer fills the center of the page as she advances forward, eyes focused on her prey, who is pushed into the corner of the page. Slumped deep into his armchair, the man's position could suggest either complete relaxation or abject fear; his head tilts back, his arms grip the armrests of the chair, and his legs sprawl out in front.Degas was fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed his subjects' social class and work.

Three vertical lines representing the doorframe and open door effectively frame the simple, evocative scene. Scholars believe the drawing is based on a scene from the novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), which tells the story of a girl who became a prostitute.The simple realities of everyday life captured the artist's interest, revealing his gift for expression in every line. When another artist invited him to go to a café, Degas objected to traveling by horse-drawn cab, saying, ""Personally, I don't like cabs. You don't see anyone. That's why I love to ride on the omnibus-you can look at people.

He drew the couple on the left with close attention to particulars, detailing the man's dinner jacket and the woman's ruffled top, her beaded necklace, and the buttons on her gloves. In contrast, the six men in the box beyond appear as a varied crowd of heads, with only the barest suggestion of their shoulders. One of Degas's contemporaries once described him as ""an artist of rare intelligence, preoccupied with ideas, which seemed strange to the majority of his fellows.

Still wearing his long overcoat over his dinner jacket, Lepic has thrust his hands deep into his pockets and rests his feet on the edge of the stage in front of him, his sunken eyes fixed on the performance ahead.Concentrating first on producing a shrewdcaricatureof Lepic, Degas did not bother to erase surplus lines to create a neat image. Instead, he drew with increasing strength on top of his early strokes until he discovered a form he liked. For example, he redrew Lepic's left shoe several times as he experimented to find the correct angle. In contrast, Lepic's face was hastily but assuredly drawn and needed no corrections.

From Guillaume Tasset, Degas obtained photographic supplies and sought advice about procedures, and from Tasset's daughter Delphine, who operated the photo studio, he ordered enlargements.

His comment above makes clear that he was aware of this response to his work. An early practitioner ofRealism, Degas captured women engaged in mundane tasks--laundresses ironing, prostitutes waiting for clients, and, most frequently, women bathing.The intimate subject of this painting, a woman bathing in a private interior, is one that invites voyeurism. Degas depicted the woman lying on a divan, while her maid dries or combs her hair. With her back pushed to the extremeforegroundof the images, she seems to hold the viewer at bay. Bracing herself with her left arm, the woman uncomfortably raises her left leg against the edge of the bathtub. Such unnatural poses have perplexed critics of Degas's time, as they do viewers today.

He dies under the care of the faithful Kaled, who in the end is revealed to be a young maiden in disguise who is in love with him. The stiff body of the dead hero contrasts with the sagging, limp posture of the bereaved Kaled.Eugène Delacroix displayed his skill at depicting a literary subject on a small scale.

In orientalizing scenes like this one, he captured the struggles of the heart, matching his innovative use of color and loosely applied brushwork with unprecedented and controversial themes.Delacroix exhibited this watercolor in the Salon of 1831. Having learned the watercolor technique from his British friends, he used it both for independent works of art and as a medium for sketching nature. He aptly described his approach, saying, ""The special charm of watercolor, beside which any painting in oil always appears rusty and yellowed, is due to the inherent transparency of the paper.""",9 9/16 x 7 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/11201001.jpg,French,"Watercolor, brown ink with touches of gouache and a graphite underdrawing","Episode from ""The Corsair"" by Lord Byron"

Completed in 1847, Delacroix's decorative program illustrated the themes of Philosophy, Science, Poetry, Law, and Theology. Related to the theme of Poetry, this pencil drawing on tracing paper, is one of several in which Delacroix explored this dynamic composition.

The horsemen he encountered in Morocco were among his favorite subjects.

On visits to Delacroix's studio twenty years later, Sand admired the new, rectangular painting of the subject the artist was working on. That canvas was promised to another admirer, so Delacroix made this nearly identical pastel for her and wrote to Sand's son, Maurice, informing him of the gift.Highly educated in the classics, Delacroix depicted subjects from antiquity throughout his life.

In an instant, homes have been reduced to rubble; incongruously colorful shards are littered with clothing, personal effects, and debris. In the distance, the few remaining palm trees underscore the fact that everything else in the scene has been flattened, razed, destroyed. At the photograph's center, a single man embodies the tsunami's human toll. This despondent figure looks over the remains of his home, searching for anything salvageable and, most of all, remembering lives lost.French photographer Luc Delahaye took this photograph in early January 2005--about ten days after the Indian Ocean earthquake that triggered a series of devastating tsunamis across Southeast Asia. Delahaye had first arrived in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh; but finding the international press concentrated there, he traveled southeast to Meulaboh. In this photograph, he focuses his camera on a part of the city closest to the seashore and worst hit by the tsunami. From a distant, frontal point of view, his camera records the scene with detail and accuracy and includes an unusual peripheral vision that reveals destruction as far as the eye can see.Beginning in 2001 with the Afghanistan war, Delahaye initiated a series of large-scale photographs featuring significant events of recent history. On one hand, these detailed, frontal works relate to the tradition of documentary photography. On the other, their size and narrative power evoke nineteenth-century European painting.

Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates.

7 1/2 x 5 11/16 in.,Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond,1855,"The woman in a straw hat with a blanket draped over her shoulders was a patient at the Surrey County Lunatic Asylum. In 1848 Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond became superintendent of the female department there and began a systematic photo-documentation of the inmates to supersede the engraved portraits commissioned by his predecessor. Diamond made the photographs both for the patients' personal records and to serve as aids in diagnosis and treatment. This patient's diagnosis is unknown, but the fact that the photograph was made in an insane asylum leaves open the interpretation of the scene. The way the woman cradles the dead bird with its limp, broken neck while wearing a surprised, slightly bemused expression presents an uneasy question of whether she mourns the bird's death or was the cause of it.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/05185501.jpg,British,Albumen print,Seated Woman with Bird

With their fanciful chinoiserie scenes of gold and platinum pagodas on a black ground, the wine coolers imitate Chineselacquerwork. In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Sèvres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00619701.jpg,French,Hard-paste porcelain; black ground color; platinum and gold decoration,Pair of Wine Bottle Coolers

This watercolor is a study for one of thirty-eight images that artist Gustave Doré created to illustrate editions of the poem published in 1875 and 1876.This scene takes place near the end of the poem (lines 564-569), after the Mariner is forever cursed for shooting an albatross. This slaughter triggers a curse that causes the death of the Mariner's entire crew, forcing him to navigate the seas alone for seven days and nights.This image illustrates the moment the masts of Mariner's ship disappear into a mighty white froth, shown at the center left. A pilot and his son have just rescued the Mariner, but thought him dead. When the Mariner instead takes the oars, as seen here at center, the men think he is the Devil and go insane. Doré depicts one of them slumped at the base of the picture frame, behind the Mariner. The other lolls over the right side of the boat. The dark, austere figure of the Holy Hermit, looms at the top right of the boat, perhaps signaling the misery awaiting the Mariner on shore, where he will be doomed to wander the earth for eternity to tell his story as penance.Doré's varied watercolor techniques and the work's large size both serve the drama of the poem.The waves, in their gloomy palette and multiple washes of brown, grey, black, and white, offer a convincing sense of depth and foreboding. White heightening evokes a splash of foam that ribbons up in the air like lightning on the front right of the boat.

Large, white-ground lekythoi with outline drawing like this one are unusual in the early 400s B.C., yet three such lekythoi can be attributed to Douris.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to paint over the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes.

Scenes of the rivers Seine and Marne were among the artist's favorite subjects, the foliage and reflections of sky and scenery were prime inspiration for his pointillist works.The pointillist technique creates an overall image through tiny spots of color. It allows the viewer to almost feel the artist at work, as one can pick out the precise taps of the brush tip against the paper. When seen from afar, for example, this vista's gentle curves, especially those of the bank of trees at right, capture a lush depth and even volume. Up close, however, one can appreciate how this pointillist surface is built up of precise groupings of varying blues and greens, with highlights created by the tiny dots of yellow and of white paper showing through.The palette of this particular work has several striking elements. For example, the choice of orange for the water and clouds creates a sense of excitement in what might otherwise be a purely languorous, even pretty scene.The present sheet is closely related to a painting depicting the same view of the Marne, dated 1888 and currently in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris. This drawing is unlikely to have been a preparatory study, and is instead a more abstract adaptation after the painting, perhaps completed for a collector as a finished work of art in its own right.The work is signed by Dubois-Pillet in watercolor at the lower right.",6 1/4 x 8 11/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31329201.jpg,French,Watercolor over traces of black chalk,The Banks of the Marne at Dawn

In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds.

He then modeled the figure in three dimensions, using a combination of thin, parallel lines, cross-hatching, and short, rapid, repeated strokes.

El Greco's use of dramatic colors and exaggerated proportions distorts the figure, conveying the transcendent moment when Christ sublimated his physical pain and commended his spirit to God. Turning his eyes upward toward heaven, Christ looks away from the bones and skulls that lie at his feet, representative of his triumph over death. Light plays across his undulating form, illuminating his tortured body against the dark background. To heighten empathy between the viewer and Christ, the elongated but graceful figure appears alone. This private, devotional image was meant to encourage contemplation and spiritual reflection.Few paintings by El Greco can be entirely attributed to the artist himself, rather than his workshop.

He made several preparatory drawings for the painting, including one in the J.

Public, historical, andallegoricalfigures along with the artist's family and friends made up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the center of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functioned as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed--a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littré, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton leading on the eager, mindless crowd.After rejection byLes XX,the artists' association that Ensor had helped to found, the painting was not exhibited publicly until 1929.

Several features of the scene, such as the couch, the pillow, and especially the wreath the man wears, reveal that he is a participant at a symposion or drinking party. Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use at such parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of revelry and drinking. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented problems for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to fit upright figures in this limited, curving space. Artists devised different solutions for this problem: some drew a line across the circle to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. On this vase, Epiktetos came up with a creative solution. He drew a line across the circle but made it the man's couch, rather than a ground-line. The edge of the man's mantle slipping down behind and below the line, creates the impression of depth and space. Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it.",3 1/16 x 9 15/16 x 7 1/16 to 7 3/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/01415201.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,Wine Cup with a Singing Reveler

The precise identification of this figure is unclear: the youth may represent some mythological figure for whom sandals are meaningful, such as Theseus or Jason, or he may be a generic youth engaging in an everyday activity. The pose of this figure, standing but leaning over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C., yet this carver's skill in depicting a three-quarter view of the youth and in rendering the musculature in detail set this gem apart.Scarabs were pierced and generally worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the beetle side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When serving as a seal, the ring was removed, the scarab swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax placed on an object to identify and secure it.Greek gem carving changed dramatically in form, materials, and technique in the-mid 500s B.C. One of these changes was the introduction of the scarab, with its back carved like a beetle and its flat surface an intaglio. The scarab form ultimately derived from Egypt, where it had been used for seals and amulets for centuries. Certain features of Greek scarabs, however, such as the form of the beetle and the hatching around the intaglio motif, show the influence of Phoenician models, which the Greeks probably saw on Cyprus.",5/8 x 3/8 x 5/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/01120501.jpg,Greek,Carnelian,Gem Engraved with an Athlete Adjusting His Sandal

After training, Greek athletes coated themselves in oil and used a strigil to scrape off the sweat, oil, and dirt. In part because it fills the oval space well, the pose of this figure, bending over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C. The difficult three-quarter view of the youth, the rendering of the musculature, and details such as the duck's head decorating the end of the strigil, however, display this artist's unique skills. The frequent depiction of athletes on gems of the late 500s B.C. reflects the interests of the men who owned them.A scaraboid is a simplified scarab. Rather than being carved as a beetle, the curved side of the stone is left plain. An intaglio design decorates the flat side. This scaraboid form gradually replaced the scarab in Greece in the 400s B.C.Scaraboid gems were pierced and worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the curved side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When needed as a seal, the ring was removed, the gem swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax to identify and secure property.

In this instance, however, the vase is a mug that was used for drinking, ladling, or measuring liquids.Because of imperfections in its manufacture, this mug helps illustrate how Greek vases were decorated. In most workshops, the master painters would paint the figures and a small strip of glaze around them. An apprentice would then cover the rest of the vase with glaze. On this example, the apprentice carefully dipped most of the cup into a bucket of glaze, except for the side with the figure.

Eucharides would have been one of the handsome adolescents in Athens in the years around 480 B.C., and the Eucharides Painter received his name from his fondness for this boy. A kalpis is a rounded variant form of ahydriaor water vessel. Greeks always drank their wine mixed with water, and a vessel like this one would have held the water at a symposion.

They probably name Athena andPerseus, the Greek hero, indicating that the krater depicted Perseus, accompanied by hispatrondeity Athena, decapitating thegorgonMedusa.Euphronios worked in the newred-figure technique, which allowed painters greater ability to render realistic and three-dimensional representations of the human body. One element that allowed this was the fact that in red-figure the artist could draw interior details of figures either with dilute, normal, or thickened glaze, thereby giving them a sense of shading andmass. As can be seen here inAthena'shair, the dots of thick glaze standing up from the surface of the vase give the decoration a literal as well as visual three-dimensionality.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00906901.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,Fragmentary Mixing Vessel with Athena

Thus, the satyr's anatomical markings are rendered by incision, rather than drawn with gloss.Because Dionysos was the god of wine, his activities were typically set in vineyards. Here, the grapevines are outlined byrelieflines and colored with golden dilutewash. The bunches of grapes that hang from the vines are rendered in relief. Such three-dimensional grapes, common in LateArchaicred-figure vase-painting, are unprecedented in white ground representations.A pioneer in the development of the red-figure style of vase-painting, Euphronios seems to have turned to potting later in his career.

This instinctive understanding of composition is borne out by his recognition that a tree, an automobile, and a farmhouse could be aligned in such a way as to create a perfectly balanced arrangement.The dramatic interplay of geometry is the most striking feature of this photograph of an early Ford parked alongside a farmhouse. Three rooflines dominate the composition and create a series of horizontal planes. The main building's siding underscores the horizontal, while the siding on a single-story extension emphasizes the vertical. Two brick chimneys flanking the ends of the farmhouse and curtains hanging on the lower story's windows extend the sense of verticality. A tall tree, spreading its bare branches throughout the upper half of the image, enlivens the composition, juxtaposing nature's irregular patterns with the farmhouse's formal structure.",6 7/8 x 8 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/05229301.jpg,American,Gelatin silver print,"Westchester, New York, Farmhouse"

84.XM.956.440,Walker Evans,1933,"[Walker] Evans's style is based on moral virtues of patience, surgical accuracy and self-effacement. In order to force details into their firmest relief, he could only work in brilliant sunlight, and the sun had to be on the correct side of the streets. Often many trips to the same house were necessary to avoid shadows cast by trees or other houses; only the spring and fall were favorable seasons. The forms were sharpened until so precise an image was achieved, that many of the houses seem to exist in an airless nostalgia for the pastSo wrote Lincoln Kirstein about Evans's images when Evans had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1931 Evans traveled throughout New England photographing Victorian architecture. This study of the gingerbread, or decorative trimming, on a pump house in Kennebunkport, Maine, subtly juxtaposes clean, graphic shadows and highlights with the more fanciful ornamentation of the architecture.

Tall, dark, and handsome in a crisp white linen suit and straw boater, this ""Havana Citizen"" standing down by the newsstand filled with glamorous movie magazines casts a wary glance at a subject just out of camera range.

The struggle to regain voting and citizenship rights began in this period, and African-Americans throughout the state established civic and voter leagues known as citizenship schools. Because illiteracy rates were high, ideas about voting and desegregation spread by word-of-mouth when people came together in small groups.It is difficult to know whether this topic spurred Evans to make the image. Although he was in the Deep South to photograph white sharecroppers forFortunemagazine, Evans had a habit of photographing whatever interested him.

The first is honest, the second is not honest; both are American.Walker Evans declared that he was not interested in ""educated architecture,"" but in vernacular styles such as those seen in this image of an industrial town. Using moral terms to compare the commercial building of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the foreground with the domestic architecture of a house in the background, Evans found the latter to be lacking in authenticity.Although architecture may have been Evans's primary interest, his inclusion of the railroad in the left-hand corner of the image added a dynamic as well as a documentary aspect to the composition. Since colonial times, New Jersey had been an important link for importing and exporting goods to New York and Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg, N.J. was one of the earliest stops on the railroad.",7 1/4 x 9 3/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/05234601.jpg,American,Gelatin silver print,"Part of Phillipsburg, New Jersey"

Perhaps they are a couple so accustomed to one another that there is no need for acknowledgement. Perhaps they are simply looking out toward Main Street, observing the activities of their neighbors.

He developed methods that are still used by commercial photographers today.

Across a desolate and featureless landscape, not a single figure can be found. The landscape is inhabited only by cannonballs--so plentiful that they first appear to be rocks--that stand in for the human casualties on the battlefield. The sense of emptiness and unease is heightened by the visual uncertainty created by the changing scale of the road and the sloping sides of the ravine.Borrowing from the Twenty-thirdPsalmof theBible, the Valley of Death was named by British soldiers who came under constant shelling there. Fenton traveled to the dangerous ravine twice, and on his second visit he made two exposures. Fenton wrote that he had intended to move in closer at the site. But danger forced him to retreat back up the road, where he created this image.On a commissioned assignment, Fenton traveled in 1853 to the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, where England, France, and Turkey were fighting a war against Russia.

He became a servant in the house of an Egyptian official and prospered for a time, until he was falsely accused of a crime and imprisoned.In this pen and ink drawing, Joseph is depicted in prison with his fellow inmates, the Pharaoh's baker and butler, both of whom had offended their royal master. While in custody, each had an unsettling dream and turned to Joseph for interpretation.Joseph sits on the far right addressing the butler and baker emphatically with one arm outstretched toward the viewer as he explains the dreams. The figure on the left is likely the baker and sits and listens impassively, while the figure on the right is probably the baker who listens attentively with his head resting in his hand.

He holds grapes and a wine cup, while she squeezes grapes into a ewer of wine at her side. She wears the golden crown--set with red gems to look like roses--that Bacchus gave her upon their marriage.Subjects drawn from classical antiquity--and this sculpture's frontal composition--were typical of Florentine bronzes from the early 1700s. Giovanni Battista Foggini arranged the two figures not to be seen from all sides but primarily from a single viewpoint in front. Despite the shallowness of the composition, the figures gracefully twist on their axes. Ariadne in particular assumes the form of a corkscrew, with her knees bending to her right and her shoulders swinging to the left. As was characteristic of sculpture at this time, the figures' bodies are much more expressive than their faces, which are emotionally blank.Foggini was working for the Medici when he made this bronze sculpture; after his death, his son sold a plaster model of the group to the Ginori Porcelain Manufactory at Doccia.

The Roman historian Pliny had described this renowned sculpture in awed language, as ""a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced."" Its celebrity prompted many bronze reductions, or smaller-scale copies including this one, made in Florence.

The image of Varie in prayer before the Virgin testifies to his personal devotion to her. It is also particularly appropriate as an introduction to Varie's personal book of hours, for in reciting his prayers he pays homage to the Virgin, much as he is pictured in prayer before her.Jean Fouquet's simple presentation gives this scene its grandeur. The Virgin and Child sit in three-quarter profile in a room defined only by its receding tile floor and deep red curtains. The Virgin's long golden hair, fine facial features, and narrow shoulders give her a youthful and delicate appearance, drawing on the contemporary ideal of female beauty. On the other hand, her erect posture and the fullness of her expansive robe convey a regal and powerful presence.

Behind him a female attendant supports a shield crowned with his family emblems, while similar coats of arms, now partially overpainted, and Varie's personal mottoes decorate the border. These signs of his new noble status are clearly significant to Varie, who rose from the merchant class through his work as an official in the French royal treasury.Although the artist Jean Fouquet presented Simon and the Virgin in separate miniatures, he linked the interior spaces of the two illuminations. The floor tiles on both pages share the same vanishing point, so that the lines of recession suggested by the floor tiles converge at a point between the two miniatures. This device suggests that, despite the red curtain behind the Virgin and the blue curtain behind Varie, the figures occupy the same room.",4 1/2 x 3 1/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00283901.jpg,French,Tempera colors and gold paint on parchment,Simon de Varie Kneeling in Prayer

He produced many tree studies, of which this is the largest one to have survived. One of the first artists to draw nature for its own sake, he worked outdoors with a sketchbook so as to observe in minute detail and understand the effects of light.

In this view of the Palatine Hill's northeast corner, a site also sketched by his friend Hubert Robert and by François Boucher, Fragonard created a powerful visual momentum by coordinating the forward thrust of the corner of the palace, the brilliant sunlight, and the towering cypresses. The dynamic, plunging perspective of walls and trees and the intense light infuse the massive architecture with life.Fragonard masterfully used both chalk and paper to create the overall effect and the varied small passages. Overall, he worked the red chalk lightly yet broadly, allowing the white of the paper to come through even in areas of deepest shading.

The woman's pose, taken from representations of the penitent saint Mary Magdalene, the reformed New Testament courtesan traditionally depicted with long, flowing hair, further emphasizes the drawing's light, satirical tone.Fragonard's light, fluent washes also work to convey a sense of abandonment, evident especially in the wildly tossed-about bedclothes. These fluid passages contrast with the arresting precision of the woman's eye, nostril, and mouth, captured in small marks made with the point of the brush.In the later 1760s, Fragonard created a number of drawings devoted to erotic themes.

The story of the Garden of Love, an allegory of the nature and progress of love that has its origins in the poetry of classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, centers on this Fountain of Love. The fountain brings forth the water in which Cupid dips his arrows or from which lovers drink and fall in love. In nearly every period, artists have painted this romantic motif. During the 1700s, artists came to treat the Fountain of Love almost as a genre subject, with lovers in contemporary dress flirting in a garden around a decorative fountain. With this version, Jean-Honoré Fragonard returned the allegory to its classical origins and imbued it with the thrilling rush of those first beguiling moments of love.

A minimally defined face reveals only an impassive expression--this is a human figure outside of time or place.Elisabeth Frink traced her interest in sculpting the male figure back to World War II. As a child, her family lived near an airfield that was visited frequently by Polish airmen who struck her as foreign and mysterious. According to the artist, many of her representations of men were influenced by these early memories and consequently she treated the male body as withheld, mysterious, and threatening.  In addition to producing many male busts, Frink created imposing, essentially anonymous men in a variety of poses or guises--standing, seated, spinning, winged, and on horseback.

Late medieval knights undoubtedly enjoyed reading the adventures of such earlier heroes, and they would have drawn inspiration from Charles's exploits.Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, commissioned this enormousmanuscriptfor his already sumptuously endowed library of more than seven hundred volumes, one of the great libraries of the 1400s.Several years after Philip's death, theilluminationof this extravagant undertaking had barely begun. In 1468 ducal accounts show payments to Pol Fruit of Bruges for painting the initials in the third volume. A year or so later, Philip's son and heir DukeCharles the Boldhired Loyset Liédet to paint the book's 123miniatures. Court accounts record that Liédet received his final payment in 1472, showing that the entire manuscript took almost a decade to complete.The four volumes of the book, with 101 of the original miniatures, belong to the Royal Library in Brussels, which acquired the core of Philip the Good's library.

The lack of a proper station platform, however, suggests that some passengers remained aboard the train and that this was a momentary stop to produce a contrived image. The conspicuous absence of women in the image is also a reminder that pioneering was primarily done by men: in 1850 only 7,000 of California's 94,000 residents were women.Alexander Gardner made this photograph two years before the completion of the transcontinental railroad, when the railroad companies were investing heavily in advertising. Many companies hired photographers to produce large images such as this one along their routes for documentary and promotional purposes. To create a sense of movement echoing the exciting advance of the train across the landscape, Gardner positioned his camera directly on top of the rails, with the Union Pacific train boldly emerging from the left and receding across thepicture plane.",13 x 18 11/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/06722901.jpg,American,Albumen print,"Group at Junction, Kansas"

Gauguin found the inspiration he was looking for in Colonial French Tahiti, where he made this life-size drawing of a rather defiant looking teenage girl. In the drawing, he boldly articulated her head, face, and neck, while indicating her shoulders and collar with lighter lines. But the girl's Western dress suggests that Tahiti was not the exotic land Gauguin had imagined: missionaries had destroyed its pre-European culture. Using flat, decorative forms, Gauguin presented Tahitian women as mysterious, unknowable creatures.",16 1/2 x 12 1/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/14202501.jpg,French,Charcoal,Head of a Tahitian Woman
2008.5,Paul Gauguin,1892,"I have just finished a severed kanak [Pacific Islander] head, nicely arranged on a white cushion, in a palace of my invention and guarded by women also of my invention.--Paul GauguinWriting to his friend Daniel de Monfreid, Paul Gauguin referenced in an almost offhand way this startling painting of a decapitated human head, which he made during his first stay in Polynesia in the early 1890s. Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words ""Arii"" and ""Matamoe"" in the canvas' upper left. The first means ""noble;"" the second, ""sleeping eyes,"" a phrase that implies ""death.""The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic ""primitivism."" In his collage-illustrated bookNoa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization.Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a ""primitive"" culture.",18 7/8 x 29 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31027701.jpg,French,Oil on coarse fabric,Arii Matamoe (The Royal End)
2002.18,Paul Gauguin,1895 - 1897,"Paul Gauguin may have carved this almost life-sized head as a symbolic self-portrait. He made the sculpture while living in Tahiti, where he studied the native culture and, to a great extent, identified with the local people. Despite his pampered upbringing, Gauguin saw himself as a ""savage,"" untamed by the civilizing force of French society.In this mysterious sculpture, Gauguin's own features are suggested, combined with Polynesian attributes, such as a broad nose. The hypnotic eyes and the smooth, warm surface of the finely finished wood are captivating. To Western viewers, the sinister horns suggest evil; however, in Tahiti, this attribute resembles a style of hair--bunched in knots at either side of the head--worn by young men as an expression of power.This intriguing and complex sculpture was probably displayed in Gauguin's home in Tahiti, but it was lost sometime in the 1890s. Until its rediscovery in the 1990s,Head with Hornswas known only from two photographs that Gauguin pasted intoNoa Noa, a manuscript meant to explain his painting and Tahitian culture to his European contemporaries.",head,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/14461701.jpg,French,Wood with traces of polychromy,Head with Horns
2007.33,Paul Gauguin,1899 - 1900,"If my work must be limited to watercolor, pastel, or anything else all the spirit goes out of it ... I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all...--Paul GauguinNear the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see.On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages.Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive ""printings,"" Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve.Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of ""the fall of man"" enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions.This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.",25 1/4 x 19 1/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/30635601.jpg,French,"Black printer's ink, ochre ink, liquid solvent on wove paper (recto); Graphite and blue crayon pencil with traces of diluted oil medium (verso)",Eve ('The Nightmare')

With his right arm wrapped limply around Belisarius's neck and his eyes closed, the youth balances precariously between life and death. Belisarius's eyes are also closed, but guided by his stick he moves forward with determination and purpose. He rises heroically against the spectacular sunset, a monumental figure creating a powerful outline against the sky. But the flaring sunset also signals a chill night and the uncertainty of the path ahead.Belisarius was a popular Byzantine general of the Roman Empire whose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In 1767, a novel by Jean-François Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for artists--including Jacques-Louis David (François Gérard's teacher), Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Jean-Baptiste Stouf (whose sculptureBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).For this painting, Gérard both drew and departed from Marmontel's retelling of Belisarius's life. The general's young companion is present in Marmontel's novel. But to stress the bravery and pathos of the subject, Gérard introduced the incapacitating snakebite. While Belisarius was typically depicted in the act of begging, Gérard shows him standing and erect, his muscular form in sharp contrast to his guide's weakening body. The prominent helmet hanging from Belisarius's belt emphasizes the general's heroic past and underscores the injustice of his fall from favor.",35 3/4 x 29 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/25807901.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,Belisarius

The dramatic story of an Arab Christian living as an infidel within his Muslim homeland tapped the vogue for Orientalism, which stemmed in part from Napoleon's recent campaigns in Egypt and Syria.

Lying on its side, the small rabbit is flanked by the game birds: an ortolan and a snipe with a long beak. A cauliflower with raggedly trimmed stalk and leaves rises above the animals. The still life also includes an onion, a turnip, a gherkin, a truffle, and a morel mushroom. Leafy plants peek out at the edges of a rocky ground evoking the earthen floor of a wood or glade.The termMachine d'Argent(literally, ""silver machine"") was first assigned to this sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, who acted as intermediary between François-Thomas Germain and thepatron, Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg. In the 1700s, the wordmachinesignified an artistic innovation as well as a mechanicaldevice. Germain was specifically commissioned to create a decorative centerpiece to complement a series of paintings owned by the Duke that depicted exotic animals and scenes of the hunt. The sculpted game birds and rabbit represent trophies of the hunt. Combined with the root vegetables and mushrooms, the animals also alluded to the ingredients of a rich stew.Using a secret casting technique,Machine d'Argenttook seven months to create. Germain cast some of the still life elements from molds of dead animals or vegetables. These individual elements were then assembled together on the base. The rich variety of detail showcased Germain's ability to transform silver into the diverse textures of nature: from the soft fur of the rabbit and downy feathers of the ortolan to the multi-beaded head of cauliflower and the smooth, waxy skin of the onion bulb.",8 1/4 in. x 1 ft. 2 1/2 in. x 9 1/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26675401.jpg,French,Silver,"""La Machine d'Argent"" or Centerpiece for a Table (surtout de table)"

Later, Gérôme's pupil Charles Bargue included a lithograph after it in their influential teaching manual, Drawing Course (1866 - 1871).  The drawing depicted one of only two non-European subjects in the book. In contrast to the Romantic artists Géricault and Delacroix, Gérôme's approach seems dispassionate and documentary.

So wrote Jacques de Gheyn of his goals for his lavishly illustrated bookThe Exercise of Arms,published in 1607. In this preparatory drawing for the book, de Gheyn strove to create the illusion of a living soldier, carefully modeled in the round and exhibiting a wealth of detail both in costume and weaponry. Focusing on the intricate task of lighting the fuse of his musket, the soldier wears a large plumed hat, billowing striped pantaloons, and high boots, with powder charges strung across his breast. De Gheyn used a simple but imposing pose to create interest, with long, diagonal lines created by the soldier's musket, his sword, and the intersecting angle of his musket rest.Conceived as a military handbook for the infantry,Exercise of Armscontained one hundred and seventeen designs illustrating the use of the smallshot, the musket, and the pike. Count Johann II of Nassau-Siegen commissioned the text to give the Dutch army a set of clear and systematic military procedures for training soldiers.

His features seem more realistic, more like a portrait than the other, obviously imaginary figures, and his position squarely facing the viewer also isolates him. The care with which Jacques de Gheyn II rendered the boy's fanciful costume also contrasts with the other heads. Paying close attention to the fall of light, de Gheyn evoked the textures of the youth's clothing--especially the turban--with beautiful, varied penwork that demonstrates the creases and gathers. He built up the other heads using rather somewhat more regular cross-hatching.De Gheyn first sketched the three foreground figures of the young boy and two men, then later added the angel and the female head. He seems to have been one of the first artists to mingle figures drawn from nature with those from his imagination.

2003.23,Jacques de Gheyn II,1609,"At first glance, this drawing of a frog appears to be a closely observed study of the natural world. Jacques de Gheyn II meticulously recorded the amphibian's long hind legs and loose skin. But on closer inspection the frog was clearly imbued with human characteristics. Its webbed feet were transformed into claw-like hands and the exaggerated hump on its back evokes a grotesque old man. With its raised head and prominent eye, the frog even appears to hold an impassive, almost haughty expression. De Gheyn pushed the boundaries of the natural world further: the frog sits atop a pile of coins and with its left ""hand"" grasps a sphere about the same size as its twisted trunk.Somewhere between a realistic rendering of nature and an imaginative fantasy, the frog is an allegory of avarice. The creature does not merely rest on the coins but reaches greedily and uncouthly between its legs to grasp at them. The large sphere may symbolize the earth and the frog all the world's greed. Appropriate to the sin of avarice, the humanized frog is itself a monstrous perversion of the natural world.Fascinated by nature, De Gheyn created a large number of allegorical and anatomical drawings of amphibians, mice and rats, horses and donkeys, and insects. This small study was probably part of a much larger sheet covered with other fantastical images.

Using a wide variety of thick and thin pen lines, dots, dashes, and calligraphic hatching, De Gheyn conveyed the textural effects of the sitter's hair and rough, aged skin.

Although the pair are based onantiquemodels, the animal subject and intense emotionalism are characteristic of the late 1500s and early 1600s.In a play of space and movement, theManneristsculptor Giambologna arranged the figures' limbs in a circle. Although the piece has a principal frontal view, the animals yield a variety of different views as a spectator walks around the sculpture. The artist endowed the work with vivid details: the graphically rendered skin pulled by the lion's claws, the taut muscles of the bull's legs, and the longer hair on the top of the bull's head, carefully distinguished from the shorter fur around his flared nostrils.After Giambologna sculpted the model, Antonio and/or Giovanni Francesco Susini's bronzefoundrycast the sculpture.

A sense of serenity and calm pervades this depiction of the Pentecost.Although only eight inches tall, this miniature has an impressive monumentality. The illuminator Girolamo da Cremona used the compositional and mathematical principles employed by fifteenth-century painters who worked on a larger scale. The miniature is symmetrically organized around the clear central axis of the Virgin and the dove: windows flank the dove, an equal number of apostles kneel in parallel rows, and candlesticks and books on the mantelpiece frame the Virgin. To relieve the monotony of the strict symmetry, the artist varied details such as the colors of the apostles' robes, the men's gestures, and the arrangement of books around the candles. Similarly, an open window opposes a closed one.The Pentecost miniature was made for a liturgical book or a book of private devotion.

Even Mary's headdress provided an opportunity for an eye-catching, energetic shape fluttering against the flowering vines.Jan Gossaert set the figures in an inventive complex of pseudo-antique architecture, indicating his general awareness of Italian styles, probably gained through prints from Italy, which often circulated in Northern Europe, rather than from actual experience.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00065801.jpg,Netherlandish,Oil on panel,The Holy Family

She is pretty, not vacuous, but her questioning gaze and awkward cradling of the jug betray her uncertainty. Goya's caption, the drawing's title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding.

Many of the buildings in this view were palaces of important Venetian families. The most prominent among them is the two-toned Palazzo Bembo on the canal's left bank. Its owners, and Guardi's likelypatrons, even appear on the palace's upper balcony.Guardi appreciated Venice as a city of constant change rather than as a static tourist destination.

Artists usually made such drawings from the nude, known asacadémies, in an art academy or in an artist's studio. Guercino probably made large-scale drawings like this one as demonstration pieces to inspire the pupils in his own academy. He made other oiled-charcoal nude studies of this model around the same time. For these studies, Guercino typically used rough, light-brown paper and charcoal soaked in oil, which made the line darker and more permanent. For luminosity, he added occasional touches of white chalk highlights. This combination enabled him to create luminous shadows or reflected light within deep shadow and to suggest the texture of flesh. His masterly technique simplified forms and distinctively modeled them with soft lines and broad shading to suggest the play of light.",20 9/16 x 16 13/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00029401.jpg,Italian,"Black chalk dipped in gum, heightened with white chalk on brown paper",Study of a Seated Young Man

Although Guercino rarely painted portraits, he used a composition that had become a standard for papal portraiture since the Renaissance. But Guercino placed less emphasis on the trappings of power than earlier papal portraits and more on his subject's character.

The gravel was so hard that they sometimes had difficulty drilling far enough in to place the gunpowder. After a successful blast, the gravel was removed one wheelbarrow at a time. It was harrowing work, and not even the overseer was spared from danger: he lost an eye after one faulty blast. The successful construction of this passage, which still exists, serves as a testament to the hard work and determination of the men who built the transcontinental railroad.Gift of Weston J. and Mary M.

Some even believed that they were the work of the devil. The steam, smoke, and sparks emitted from the belly of these monsters caused a great deal of anxiety for timid souls.

The chubby, nude infants that play musical instruments around the body and on the stem of the vessel and the cherub with his bow and arrow on the top were probably added later in the century.This stemmed cup was made as a work of art to amaze and astonish and was never actually used. Only highly skilled craftsmen could produce such fragile, intricate forms, and much ivory, an extremely costly and rare material, must have been wasted before a perfect vessel was produced.

Although the piece can be viewed from all sides, the carved surface is richer and more textured from the front than from the back. The sculpture's shrouded or veiled appearance and dark, almost leathery surfaces, create a slightly foreboding quality.Barbara Hepworth often pierced or punctured her forms, creating a play of positive and negative space. Here, the four openings accentuate the sculpture's relation to the surrounding landscape--an interplay reinforced by the work's title.To create this sculpture, Hepworth began with an aluminum armature. Layer upon layer of plaster was piled onto this sturdy structure. When the plaster dried, Hepworth then directly carved into the hard surface, working and reworking it until she reached a final form. The form was then cast in bronze in two parts.

Individual figures in amusing poses were often used to decorate red-figured drinking cups destined for use in the symposion. But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it. It features white, red, and orange designs painted atop of a black-gloss ground, and often includes delicately incised silhouette. The technique was invented around the same time as thered-figure technique, in approximately 525 B.C.

Hoefnagel painted a pear, caterpillar, centipede, and hover fly in colors that harmonize with those of the text. The contrast between the yellow and ochre of the moth, hover fly, and pear and the black of the caterpillar echoes the contrast between the gold used for the initial and the decorative filler and the black ink used for the majority of the text.

To preserve Bocskay's calligraphic flourish, Hoefnagel painted the flower so as to suggest that the stem pierced the page.

He placed the peony, two species of irises, an amaryllis, a may beetle, and a june bug in an attractive arrangement on the page. He drew the delicate forms carefully and added lush color in a palette of green, blue, and red. He used plain black chalk to represent the shadow cast by the beetle's body, illusionistically raising the beetle's legs off the ground with this trompe-l'oeil effect.Hoffmann may have intended this arrangement of nature studies to be hung as a painting, since it was listed as such in the archives of its original owner and it remained in a frame until well into the 1800s.

2001.12,Hans Hoffmann,1585,"Nibbling on a leaf pulled from a stalk of Lady's Mantle, an alert hare sits at the edge of a pine forest. Unlike the darkness one would expect to find in a forest, Hans Hoffmann painted a theatrically illuminated scene. Each plant and insect--snail, cricket, beetle--is seen in vivid detail. The finely wrought leaves of the thistle, the sprawling fronds of a plantain, and the bright blue flowers of the Hare Bell attest to Hoffmann's meticulous treatment of the subject. In fact, none of these plants could have co-existed in the natural world. Hoffmann imaginatively combined numerous individual nature studies in a single painting.Hoffmann's golden-brown hare is based on Albrecht Dürer's famous and influential watercolor which, much like hisStag Beetle, shows a hare against a plain ground. Hoffmann had seen Dürer's hare while in Nuremburg. Later, when he went to work in the court of Emperor Rudolf II, he helped the Emperor acquire the watercolor for hisKunstkammer. Hoffmann's hare differs from Dürer's however, appearing amid a striking arrangement of elegant plants and insects. At the time it was painted, this arrangement of nearly life-size subjects was entirely unique, not only within Hoffmann's body of work, but also within the tradition of German nature study.","Unframed [with radius of panel, right side]: 24 1/2 x 30 7/8 in.",www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/14042501.jpg,German,Oil on panel,A Hare in the Forest

Presented as a sweet, intelligent child, Louise was about five when sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon carved this portrait for her father, an architect and friend of the artist. Avoiding the empty sentimentality common in representations of children in the 1700s, he captured Louise's intelligence and liveliness. The youth of the sitter and the artist'snaturalisticrendering lighten the formality of thebust, a format adopted fromantiquesculpture. One of the greatest portrait sculptors of the late 1700s, Houdon popularized the genre of child portrait busts.Houdon made several copies and versions of this work. He probably made the first generation of this work, aterracottamodel now in theLouvre, as a gesture of friendship to Louise's father, Alexandre-Theodore Brongniart. Brongniart, the French geologist and mineralogist who served as the director of the SèvresPorcelainFactory from 1800 until his death in 1847, probably then commissioned the marble version.

The dusty landscape seems devoid of any activity or importance, but in fact is the politically fraught Mexican-US border.Graciela Iturbide's photographs capture nuances of cultural identity. Even the tattoo is a highly coded element; it depicts Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe--also calledLa Virgen Morena, or the brown-skinned Virgin. Some speculate that Mexico's indigenous Virgin of Guadalupe has roots in the Aztec mother goddess Tonantzin. The characteristic wavy, pointed tendrils that surround her evoke rays of holy light. However, these are also thought to refer to something organic, namely the spiked agave plant, which Mexicans ferment intopulque, mezcal, and tequila--alcoholic beverages enjoyed on the Virgin of Guadalupe's feast day.Like her mentor, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide is known for photographs that explore the diversity of her native Mexico, especially its indigenous peoples.

The clay's thickness and weight and uneven shrinking frequently caused the animals to crack and collapse in the kiln.

With this small gesture, Khnopff captured the child's vulnerability and uncertainty in facing the outside world. To further evoke a child's perception of a world scaled for grown-ups, he framed Jeanne Kéfer's tiny body against the adult-sized door and tilted the floor ever so slightly.Jeanne is further isolated by the free, abstract brushwork in the reflective door window behind her. Typical for Khnopff, Jeanne is not warm and inviting but cut off in the shallow background, a fixed haunting gaze on her face.Khnopff became a popular society portrait painter in the 1880s, using elements that served him well as an avant-garde Symbolist painter: visual realism and a mood of silence, isolation, and reverie. He frequently posed his models leaning against a closed door, flattening the space and resulting in a meditative, hermetically sealed image.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/11200701.jpg,Belgian,Oil on canvas,Jeanne Kéfer

Early in his career, the Kleophrades Painter decorated the angular form of hydria, but he later switched to the kalpis.

In contrast to the high degree of finish in his rendering of the head, Klimt treated the sitter's clothing and the back of the chair in a looser, more summary manner, highlighting the palpable emotional connection between sitter and artist.The young woman bears a noticeable resemblance to Sonja Knips, a Viennese socialite whose portrait Klimt painted during the same period. Both the painting and this drawing mark a major turning point in the evolution of Klimt's style. In their soft-focus handling, dreamlike atmosphere and pervasive eroticism, they reveal the influence of Symbolism, a key element in the art of the Vienna Secession, the avant-garde movement in which Klimt played a central role.The drawing is housed in a contemporary frame designed by the Wiener Werkstätte, a collective of artists and designers with close links to the Secession.

2009.57.2,Gustav Klimt,1901 - 1902,"Gustav Klimt's favored working practice was somewhat unorthodox: he employed a number of nude models who lounged around his studio striking spontaneous poses, which he captured with a few exquisitely economical strokes of chalk or pencil. Many such life studies remained independent works of art, but others inspired paintings.These sketches of a kneeling woman, her generous buttocks thrust toward the viewer and her luxuriant hair cascading around her head as if caught by a current of air or water, ultimately served as preparatory drawings for the foreground figure in Klimt's paintingGoldfish(now in the Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Switzerland). In the finished painting, the nude retains this pose but turns her head to gaze impudently over her shoulder; Klimt initially titled it ""To my critics"" in reference to the controversy over three highly erotic murals he painted for the University of Vienna which had been attacked by the conservative press. The fluid, stylized treatment of the model's body and hair, which verges on abstraction, suggests his enduring identification of women with water--unbounded, immaterial and elusive--a common motif in his work.Although this drawing served as a study for another work, Klimt seems to have considered it a work of art in its own right. Not only did he sign it, he also published a reproduction of the right-hand figure in the Vienna Secession periodicalVer Sacrumin 1902; faint red pencil marks--cropping indications for the photographer--frame the figure.The drawing is housed in a facsimile of a frame designed by Klimt himself, exemplifying his commitment to the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art).",12 1/2 x 17 13/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31887301.jpg,Austrian,Black chalk and red pencil,Two Studies of a Seated Nude with Long Hair

Yet Kniep overlaid Claude's legacy with the late 1700s concept of the Sublime, whose purpose was to inspire a noble and lofty awe by depicting powerful natural phenomena.Despite the drawing's large scale, Kniep rendered each element with a precision achieved, no doubt, by the ""sharpening and resharpening of the best English pencils"" that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had noted during their trip to Italy together in 1787 and 1788. Many of the detailed sketches Kniep made during the trip were the basis for his later, more finished, imaginary landscapes such as this one.

In this moralizing scene from Greek legend, the wealthy KingCroesuscalls an audience with Solon, an Athenian lawmaker and philosopher. After proudly displaying his immense wealth, the king asks Solon to name the happiest man he has ever met. Solon does not name Croesus, instead responding that he could call no man happy until his life was so judged at its end and that humble people were often more content than the wealthiest kings. This moralistic tale, extremely popular in 1600s Holland, reflected the culture's ambivalent attitudes toward wealth and consumption.Nikolaus Knüpfer used light to draw attention to the confrontation between the two figures. King Croesus and his queen are bathed in a bright light that illuminates their exquisite finery, the white satin and gold tablecloth, and the succulent delicacies and gold wares on the table. Light also falls upon the solitary figure of Solon, accentuating his isolated position below in the stage-like setting.

He added a sense of drama by intensifying the contrast between light and dark, painting the foreground fragments almost completely in shadow.Excavations of the buried city began in 1748 and continue to this day.

The term phlyax, which is used for both the play and the costumed actors, probably derives from the Greek verb ""to swell"" and finds its meaning in the actors' costumes.

Among the many artists who imitated the brilliant flickering style of Watteau's chalk work, Lancret mastered it best and developed it into a personal idiom, evolving strokes that were looser and more ethereal than those of Watteau.Lancret probably sketched the figures as a life study, not in preparation for a particular painting.

Lange understood that blankets, veils, and scarves could modify one's appearance, punctuate one's actions, and emphasize emotional moments.

MS. 103,Lieven van Lathem,1460,"This miniature originally appeared in a manuscript expressly created for Philip the Good, the duke of Burgundy that consists of a compilation of accounts of the miracles of the Virgin Mary. Philip was a highly successful political leader of his day as well as an important and influential patron of manuscript illumination. The witty scene illustrates a noblewoman's endeavor to deal with her husband's Christian mistress. In the chapel at right, the wife of the adulterous knight prays for the Virgin Mary to avenge her by punishing the mistress. However, Mary refuses the request on account of the adulteress's deep devotion to her. Subsequently when wife and mistress encounter one another in the street the mistress is so embarrassed--she falls to her knees--she promises to give up the husband. Meanwhile the wayward husband cowers behind the chapel. Given the duke's own serial philandering--he fathered several dozen children outside his marriage and relatively few within it--one cannot help but wonder how he responded to this moralizing tale.The miniature is painted entirely in grey tones, a technique called grisaille, popular in the later Middle Ages.

Joseph is modeled with subtle twists in his body, amplified by his buoyant and billowing tunic and cloak. Even his curly hair flutters with a life of its own. Fashioned from white-bodied earthenware, known as creamware, the figures are painted with lustrous jewel-like colors. Their theatricality is characteristic of Baroque sculpture.Athough most depictions present Saint Joseph as elderly, he is portrayed here as a youthful and handsome father. Inspired by the new focus on Jesus' human and family life and encouraged by the philosophies of the Counter-Reformation, the cult of Saint Joseph became more popular in the second half of the 1700s, when this sculpture was made.The subject and composition of this work are identical to those of a life-size marble of 1790 to 1791 by the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino in the Taranto Cathedral.

These episodes may have inspired both the unusual half-length form of this representation and the oval plinth, which recalls the shape of a cauldron.

In the 1850s, it was virtually impossible to render both sea and sky in the same negative. If the photographer exposed the film so that the sea or land was fully rendered, the sky would be overexposed and appear white; if exposed for the sky, the sea or land would appear dark as a silhouette. As it happened, the luminosity of the cloud-laden sky was equal to that of the water, making it possible for Le Gray to render each area exquisitely in a single negative.

If he exposed for the sky, the sea and shore would appear only as silhouettes. In this composition, he opted to let the sea and land dominate. In reality, the blowing sails and choppy waters indicate a more tumultuous sky than the one seen here.Around 1855 Le Gray began to make a series of seascapes and maritime studies.

The activity stands in dramatic relief to the serenity of the sea that it crosses; a few other boats are barely visible dots on the horizon.

Made from aluminum, three vertical ""strokes"" of pure color are frozen in space and rise to a height of more than ten feet. One edge of the yellow brushstroke cuts through the dominant stroke of black and blue; the yellow also curves into a diminutive stroke of red paint.Each brushstroke is a fully realized three-dimensional form that, somewhat implausibly, allows the viewer to experience a stroke of paint from different vantage points. The sculpture humorously reminds us that paint is literally three-dimensional.Roy Lichtenstein first explored brushstrokes as a subject in a series of paintings initiated in 1965. As with many of his works, he used a comic book source--a panel of an artist at work fromStrange Suspense Stories--as the basis for his brushstrokes. The subject became one of the artist's most recognizable images and he would return regularly to the brushstrokemotiffor more than thirty years.

Brilliantly describing surfaces and defining volume through subtle gradations of color, he depicted forms, textures, and the play of light with great immediacy.

Liotard's delicate application of white chalk records the details of her flounced sleeves and ruffled collar, and beautifully highlights the subject's attractive features.Liotard likely made this drawing in preparation for a pastel; the broad application of chalk indicates that Liotard made it as a kind of rough draft.

The pen-and-ink study on the verso may have been made first as a compositional outline for the drawing on the recto.More than thirty views of Tivoli, one of Claude's favorite subjects, survive. As always, he focused on the landscape rather than village architecture. He drew this study from nature, rather than composing it in the studio, and he may have used it in preparing a painting.According to a German painter colleague, Joachim von Sandrart, Tivoli played a role in Claude's decision to painten plein air(outdoors) rather than only in the studio: ""[I]n Tivoli, in the wild rocks at the famous cascade . . . he found me painting from life and saw that I painted many works from nature itself, making nothing from imagination; this pleased himself so much that he applied himself eagerly to adopting the same method.""",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00004401.jpg,French,Black chalk with brown and reddish-brown wash (recto); pen and ink (verso),View of Tivoli (recto and verso)

Until then, she and her attendants festoon the seemingly innocent beast with flowers, while her blue drapery flutters in the breeze. In the upper right corner, a hazy poetic light illuminates her home city of Tyre, further evoking an idyllic antique world.Claude Lorrain is known for painting complicated images that achieve a tranquil balance. This scene appears bucolic, but his composition and details also hint of impending danger. Beyond the field of delicate flowers, for example, a craggy tower looms. The women fail to notice that the bull is poised in anticipation, already straightening one of his legs for flight. Whitecaps gather behind them on the darkening sea, the backdrop to Europa's fate.Even in his day, Claude was known for developing a style called the Ideal Landscape, in which nature on the canvas surpasses the real thing in its beauty, harmony, and refinement. Here he balances formal elements, like the upright trees, ship, and towers, against the open expanse of sea and sky. Offshore, he juxtaposes the huge galleon and all its impeccable detail in the rigging and carved decoration, with Europa still on land. The maritime theme also had a deeper resonance for Claude's contemporaries, as in art criticism, the abduction of Europa was compared to a ship leaving shore.French by birth, and working in Rome, Claude often went into the countryside to do studies of nature.  One of his hallmarks is the use of a unifying light, which gives this work a kind of gentle glow.

Satyrs, part-human, part-animal companions ofDionysos, the god of wine, were a popular and fitting decoration for cups like this one intended for use at a symposion or drinking party. The decoration on this cup provides a good example of the reason that by the early 400s B.C. most Athenian vase-painters preferred to work in thered-figure technique. As this moving satyr shows, Greek artists of this period were extremely interested in accurately depicting the human body and its changes in musculature and posture. Theblack-figure technique, in which all internal markings were incised equally through the black silhouette of the figure, was inherently limited in its ability to do this. The red-figure technique with its painted internal detail was more suitable for the task.On this vase, Makron used heavy lines of black glaze, actually raised from the surface of the vase, for large contours of the body. He then applied lines of diluted glaze, which fired brown rather than black, for smaller musculature.

Thepicadoror  ""horse-master"" is caught helplessly between his mount and the wall while two spectators try to lift him to safety.Manet probably made this drawing at the scene of an actual bullfight. He used an energetic and gestural line to define the forms for the bodies of the bull and horse. Thin lines of black watercolor delineate the figures, and applied shades of color give three-dimensional form. Touches of yellow, red, blue, and brown animate the crowd of spectators, while economically applied black paint suggests details such as facial features.",7 9/16 x 8 7/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00045501.jpg,French,Watercolor over graphite,Bullfight
89.PA.71,Édouard Manet,1878,"To commemorate the recent Exposition Universelle, itself a celebration of luxury and prosperity, the French government declared June 30, 1878, a national holiday. The holiday, called theFête de la Paix(Celebration of Peace), also marked France's recovery from the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 and the bloody, divisive Paris Commune that followed. From his second-floor window, Édouard Manet captured the holiday afternoon with his most precise, staccato brushwork in a patriotic harmony of the reds, whites, and blues of the French flag that waves from the new buildings' windows.The urban street was a principal subject of Impressionist and Modernist painting; many artists aimed to show not only the transformation and growth of the Industrial Age but how it also affected society. Manet's eyes saw both elegant passengers in hansom cabs and, in the foreground, a worker carrying a ladder. The hunched amputee on crutches, perhaps a war veteran or beggar, passes by fenced-in debris left from the construction of a new train track. Manet's sensitivity to the associated costs and sacrifices tempered his optimistic view of national pride and newfound prosperity.",25 3/4 x 31 3/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00094601.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,The Rue Mosnier with Flags

Two bronze priestesses of the temple of Vesta, the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth and its fire, carry the altar bearing the sacred flame. The sacred flame and the vigilance of the maidens, who kept the altar fire burning continuously, came to symbolize eternity, a suitable association for a timepiece. The theme extends to the hour and minute hands, which are in the form of a snake, another symbol of eternity.The French craftsmen added fine chasing to emphasize decorative details on the pedestal altar, the delicate ritual vessels, and the arabesque patterns on the altar cloth surrounding the clock face.

Manuel Deutsch and such contemporaries as Albrecht Dürer and Albrecht Aldorfer employed the technique of drawing on a deeply colored ground with white strokes delineating contours or modeling figures. Ordinarily, they used a sharp quill pen and a fine pointed brush, which they handled with such control that the thinness of its strokes could rival or outstrip those of the pen.For this drawing, the artist prepared a red-brown ground, then drew the scene in black ink.

2005.114,Giacomo Manzù,1975 - 1977,"The stylized clothing of this serene, seated cardinal creates a dramatic pyramidal form. An unbroken conical sweep, the cardinal's vestment or robe extends from his feet to his mask-like face. Covering his forehead, his headdress, known as a miter, functions as the ""tip"" of the pyramid. The folds in the vestment emphasize the bronze's weight and volume but also create tension and dynamism, enlivening the form. A tiny hand emerges from beneath the garments to remind us that there is a body beneath this powerful bronze cladding. But body and vestment form an indissoluble whole.In the early 1930s, Giacomo Manzù visited Rome, where the sight of the Pope flanked by two cardinals in St Peter's Basilica struck him as a singularly timeless image. From the late 1930s to the late 1950s, the sculptor produced more than fifty cardinals--standing and seated, large and small, in bronze, alabastar, and marble. Over this long series, Manzù increasingly contained the cardinal figure in rigid compact forms that evoked funerary pyramids or pillars. With only one exception, the cardinals were all conceived without a model, their features invented entirely by the artist.","84 5/8 x 45 1/2 x 55 1/2 in., 680 lb.",www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26553101.jpg,Italian,Bronze,Seated Cardinal
2011.7.1,Robert Mapplethorpe,"1975, print 1995","A man's jacket slung over one shoulder, the cuffs of her shirt cut off with scissors, the Bohemian poet and performer Patti Smith levels her gaze outward with authority and calm. The set of her jaw and lift of her chin suggest she wears confrontation lightly. Simultaneously, a waifish delicacy haunts her tiny body. She touches the ribbon around her neck with long fingers cupped near her heart --a shy gesture and nod to the garb of the 19th-century Romantic poets she admires. With quiet ferocity, the portrait hovers between masculine and feminine, strength and vulnerability.Intimately bonded in life and work, Mapplethorpe and Smith made this image for the cover of her debut rock album,Horses.It is one of his earliest celebrity portraits, a genre in which he went on to distinguish himself. He often amplified the glamour of his subjects, but modernized conventional portrayals with provocative depictions of race, gender, and sexuality. For example, record executives, concerned that Smith with her lack of makeup and messy hair wasn't conventionally pretty enough to sell records like other ""girl singers,"" wanted to airbrush this image. Knowing Mapplethorpe would back her up, Smith refused and the image and album shaped the start of both their iconoclastic careers.",14 1/8 x 14 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/32906901.jpg,American,Gelatin silver print,Patti Smith

The composition is disconcerting, as a viewer is uncertain how the vase can balance on the corner of the table, or how exactly the planes of the foreground and background are angled. The resulting image is at once lovely and vaguely unsettling.Mapplethorpe's diverse body of work also included fashion, nudes, portraits, and erotic and sadomasochistic subjects, and is distinguished by an elegant, classical sensibility with an undercurrent of darker complexity.",13 15/16 x 13 15/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/32907701.jpg,American,Gelatin silver print,Tulips

The same elements of glamour and striking simplicity for which he is known in his celebrity and fashion portraiture are visible here, including a tightly cropped composition and uncluttered background that further dramatize the face. Mapplethorpe drew on his early commercial work for magazines, includingVogue. This aspect of his career followed the examples of other noted photographers such as Edward Steichen, Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, and Herb Ritts.His work encompassed portraits, nudes, and still lifes, often with strong erotic, homosexual, and sadomasochistic themes.

The dark shadows of the background seem to lap at his neck, shoulders and under his arms, as if he emerges from a timeless, dark sea. The sophisticated lighting also sculpts the curves of his face, collarbone, and chest to further heighten their elegant forms.This figure study is part of a large body of work featuring African-American men. Mapplethorpe was absorbed by the texture and color of their skin, which he referred to as bronze. He used Agfa's Portriga 118 paper for its ability to produce the velvety texture and glow discernible in this reproduction. His strong, uncluttered compositions of statuesque male models fused a classical sensibility with homoerotic content at a time when the male nude was not a popular subject among camera artists.",15 3/16 x 15 1/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/32908401.jpg,American,Gelatin silver print,Ken Moody

By choosing to capture the flower in profile, rather than from what would be the intuitive, vertical sightline, Mapplethorpe imbues the image with a sense of motion. The arc of the stem bows below two outstretched leaves, as if floating up or down on wings.After his beginnings with Polaroid portraits, Mapplethorpe refined his style and process in the early 1980s. Drawing on his knowledge of the 19th-century photographs he collected, he used simple compositions and careful lighting to great effect. Considered a central figure in late 20th century photography, his subjects span elegant figure studies, delicate floral still lifes, glamorous celebrity portraits, and the S&M; community.",15 1/4 x 15 3/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/32908601.jpg,American,Gelatin silver print,Tulip

At the base of this image of a calla lily, he punctuates the wide planes of black and white with what seems a decadent surprise: the three-dimensional, curving lip of the flower's edge. He explores the effects of light as a painter might experiment with a palette of colors. At the top, the flower glows milky white, reminiscent of light seen through delicate alabaster or porcelain.Mapplethorpe's spare compositions often showcase familiar subjects in unusual ways. Floral still lifes, for example, have long encouraged sexual interpretations, and especially here, given the artist's other work with erotic and sadomasochistic subjects.

Familiar with the most recent trends in Italian panel painting and Byzantine icon painting, he knew how to convey a sense of weight, volume, and depth. Drawing on these innovations, he embedded scenes of surprising naturalism within the initials.",Leaf: 22 15/16 x 15 13/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00161301.jpg,Italian,"Tempera colors, gold leaf, and ink on parchment bound between original wood boards covered with black-stained sheepskin, rebacked",Antiphonal

Jesus directs his gaze above, where the star followed by the Magi appears as a comet whose tail leads back to the baby.

The legend of Saint Nicholas, a fourth-century bishop, relates the story of the saint rescuing the daughters of an anguished father from prostitution by offering the father money for their dowries.The initial provides a keyhole-like view of a house. Through its windows, the reader sees a man weeping on the lower floor, his two daughters upstairs, and the saint to the right, proffering the necessary gold. Although the legend mentions three daughters, the artist only included two daughters and two gold balls. Saint Nicholas's story became an important theme in art of the late 1200s because the rising costs of dowries in Italy developed into such a burden that contributing to young girls' dowries became a common act of Christian charity.",22 15/16 x 15 13/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00187201.jpg,Italian,Tempera colors and gold leaf on parchment,Initial C: Saint Nicholas

MS. LUDWIG IX 18,Master of James IV of Scotland,1510 - 1520,"With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.",9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00163801.jpg,Flemish,"Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment",Spinola Hours

In addition, the scene's rocky landscape flows unimpeded on all sides, undermining the purpose of the frame. The artist depicted a sequence of events in the landscape: on the left, the funeral procession of the Virgin; at the bottom, her open grave; and in the center, her glorious Assumption into heaven. The artist drew from various popular legends to enrich the story. According to legend, the apostles were miraculously brought to her deathbed from all over the world. Here, led by John holding a palm branch, they carry the Virgin's coffin. In the center panel, the Virgin's belt, or girdle, is given to the doubting apostle, Thomas.

This compilation is called theHistorical Biblebecause the commentaries stressed the role ofscriptureas a record of historical events. Thus, in most illuminated copies, the book ofGenesis, the first of the historical books of the Bible, is profusely illustrated, while non-historical books, like those of the prophets, receive only oneilluminationeach.

On the right, several men carrying crutches have come to be healed, while a menagerie of animals in front looks up to Anthony as if listening to his words.Saint Anthony, a hermit of the 300s, renounced his worldly goods and retired to the desert of northern Egypt. In the 1100s, the Order of Knights Hospitallers, an organization that cared for the sick across Europe, adopted him as its patron saint. Although Saint Anthony was a desert hermit, he appears here wearing the black cape with the tau cross on the left shoulder worn by the Hospitallers of the 1400s. Growing out of his association with the Hospitallers, Anthony was called on to prevent and cure disease in both people and animals, which explains the assortment of followers around him.The miniature was painted by the anonymous artist known as the Master of Saint Veronica in the International style, which is characterized by bright jewel-like colors, detailed elaborate costumes, linearity, and melancholic expressions.

The book'silluminationfeatures a number ofminiaturesshowing scenes from Jesus' Passion.Not only were books of hours important in the spiritual lives of their owners, but the most beautifully and extensively illuminated ones were important luxury objects.

The two artists all painted in theInternational style, characterized by the courtly elegance of the figures and richly patterned fabrics rendered in brilliant colors and gold.

Though the artist omitted the rest of the biblical account, in which Saul changes his name to Paul and takes up an evangelical Christian mission, the initial's viewers would have been familiar with the story. In the top half of the initial, another soldier, seated erect on a more elaborately liveried steed, wears a fancy hat and tunic trimmed in green, white, and red, the colors of both the Gonzaga and Este families.

Below the text at the bottom of the page, two young men kneel before a lord. The prayer's message may have inspired the image, as the young men seem to lay down their arms and seek forgiveness.This page was removed from a famous medieval manuscript, the Turin-Milan Hours, which was begun for Jean, duke of Berry, and worked on sporadically over the course of the next fifty years by as many as ten artists.",10 11/16 x 6 15/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13828001.jpg,Flemish,"Tempera colors, gold leaf, and ink on parchment",Christ Blessing

A missal contains all the texts used for celebrating Mass, including all the chants sung by the choir but without musical notation. Only the musically elaborate portions sung by the celebrating priest are supplied with notation, suggesting that this book was designed to be used by the cardinal himself at the altar as he celebrated Mass. The elegant illuminations of the missal, consisting of decorated calendar pages, numerous historiated initials, ornamented borders, and miniatures, place the book within the tradition of Bolognese manuscript illumination. The manuscript's anonymous illuminator, known as the Master of the Brussels Initials, was trained in Bologna, a city whose book trade flourished due to the prestige and growth of the university.

The calendar notes the feasts and holidays of the church year. Since the texts of the missal are arranged according to the order in which they were said during the church year, the calendar helped the priest to identify the appropriate prayers for each day. In this missal, the calendar pages are each identified by a zodiacal sign: Aries, indicated by the ram, roughly corresponds to the month of March. The illuminator also included the representation of a Labor of the Month, corresponding to an activity traditionally associated with a particular month. Here a peasant blows two horns, heralding the coming of spring.The illuminations on this page have a distinctive grace and simplicity. The artist drew from his close observation of nature for the graceful movements of the peasant, his softly falling drapery, and the ram's delicately extended front hoof.

The use of gold for the decorative acanthus swirls in the background, the halos, and the rays surrounding Christ reinforces the majestic tone.

The illuminator expressed the tension of this great drama when the people are first shown the consecrated Eucharist: the worshippers with their varied and animated expressions seem completely caught up in the drama. Adding to the sense that the scene is capturing a specific moment, the standing monks on the left sing from a choir book with open mouths.  The scene takes place in a groin-vaulted Gothic church. The varied poses of the figures, seen in profile, three-quarter view, and from behind, stress their volumetric presence in space.

The artist, known only as the Master of the Coburg Roundels, experimented with showing Christ's torso from various angles and wrapping the loincloth in various ways around his body. He built up the folds of most of the draperies with quick hatching and added points of visual interest by modeling four of them inwash.Theversodemonstrates a similarly lively visual interplay among its various elements. The artist first lightly sketched the two studies of book bindings, then later added two, more heavily modeled drapery studies in the center and a brass corner fitting in the upper right corner, illusionistically modeled with wash andbodycolor.

The scene takes place not inside a house as recounted in the Bible but underneath a Gothic tabernacle with a starred vault, which lends it an almost liturgical or ceremonial tone.The miniature comes from alaudarioof the Company of Sant'Agnese.

Valerius points out the joyous and intemperate peasants at the front table, who cavort wildly, drink, fall down, and sleep. In contrast, the nobles in the back are models of temperance: evenly spaced at the orderly table, their bodies rigid, they eat with great sobriety. Through this contrast theilluminatorsuggested that nobles are inherently more temperate, an interpretation that does not derive from the text. Yet in the hands of the witty Master of the DresdenPrayer Book, the bad example of the pleasure-loving peasants is easily the more endearing one.",6 7/8 x 7 5/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/11231001.jpg,Flemish,Temperacolors and ink onparchment,The Temperate and the Intemperate

MS. LUDWIG IX 18,Master of James IV of Scotland,1510 - 1520,"With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.",9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00163801.jpg,Flemish,"Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment",Spinola Hours

MS. LUDWIG IX 18,Master of James IV of Scotland,1510 - 1520,"With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.",9 1/8 x 6 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00163801.jpg,Flemish,"Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment",Spinola Hours

"MS. 106, RECTO",Master of the Murano Gradual,1425 - 1450,"This leaf depicts a story from the life of Saint Jerome (about 341 - 420), one of the four doctors of the Church. One day, a lion entered the monastery where Jerome resided, causing his fellow monks to flee, but Jerome recognized that the beast was injured and he cured it by removing a thorn from its paw. The saint's monumental form fills the foreground of the composition, setting off the delicate gold tweezers Jerome uses to extract the thorn. In the background, a monk approaches with a pot of ointment and a bandage. The encounter between man and animal, in which Jerome comes to the lion's aid, is poignant, showing the moment when the lion submits to the saint, the saint's concentration as he removes the thorn, and the apprehensiveness of the attendant monk.This cutting likely represents a large miniature or initial from a gradual probably commissioned for the Camaldolese monastery of San Mattia in Murano. This manuscript was one of the most lavish and elaborately illuminated Lombard choir book commissions of the fifteenth century. The artist responsible for its decoration it is known as the Master of the Murano Gradual.

This initial was probably made for the manuscript that gives the Master his name, a gradual made for the Camaldolese monastery of San Mattia in Murano.

Focusing on the rivalry between England and France, theChronicleis a basic resource for the study of theHundred Years' War. Froissart also described the affairs of other realms, though largely as they related to the complex network of overlapping and shifting alliances around England and France.The Getty Museum'smanuscriptcontains the third of four books; its 730 pages cover only the period from 1358 to 1389, an indication of the level of detail Froissart sought to impart. The Museum's volume, from about 1480, shows the lasting esteem that theChronicleenjoyed: new copies of the text were still being made about seventy years after the author's death. The book was made inFlanders, perhaps in Bruges.

In a workshop closely associated with the count, the anonymous artists known as the Masters of Dirc van Delf illuminated this book of hours, perhaps for a member of Albrecht's family or one of his courtiers. These artists, who worked in the International style that so appealed to aristocratic taste across Europe, formed one of the first important illuminators' workshops of fifteenth-century Holland.While the Hours of the Virgin were most often illustrated with miniatures showing the Life of the Virgin, this book illustrates these services with scenes from the Passion of Christ. With their powerful dramatic style, the eight full-page miniatures provide visual meditations on the meaning of the story of Jesus, fostering the viewer's empathy for his supreme sacrifice.

The theme of the Madonna of Humility became popular in the 1400s as Christians increasingly focused on the human qualities of holy figures. The artist(s) further emphasized the Virgin's humanity by representing her nursing the infant Jesus.The rubric,Incipiunt hore de domina n[ost]ra(The hours of our Lady begin), introduces the Matins text of the Hours of the Virgin, which begins with a verse from Psalm 50:Domine labia mea aperies et os meum annunciabit laude[m] tuam(Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise).

Within this context, the miniature of Christ before Pilate serves as a visual focus for the prayers that follow. Pilate, the Roman prefect in Jerusalem who presided at Jesus' trial and gave the order for his Crucifixion, sits on a throne. Jesus' sad but patient expression suggests his acceptance of his fate.This confrontation between Pilate and Christ takes place within a shallow architectural setting much like a stage, with a flat, curtainlike, gold-patterned background behind. But the shallow space cannot contain the corporeal figures, who stand in front of the miniature's frame so that the figure of Jesus is presented both to Pilate and to the viewer.

Behind the figures, the pink cross picks up the faint, glowing hues of his suffering body. The full-page Lamentation appears within a sequence of images retelling the Passion story in this book of hours, the most popular type of private devotional manuscript of the later Middle Ages.

The figures' broad forms extend beyond the confines of the painted frame, blurring the distinction between the miniature's and the viewer's space.

The production of porcelain models of this size had never been attempted before in Europe.Some of the technical difficulties Kirchner encountered in fulfilling this commission are evident on this figure of a fox with a chicken. First, the large scale of the figure required a number of highly visible vent holes to prevent explosions in the kiln. Second, shrinkage during the firing process and strong downward pressure from the objects' own weight caused cracks of varying severity. Meissen craftsmen tried numerous ways to reduce cracking; though they were certainly very inventive, few methods worked. The cracks made a final firing with enamel colors impossible, since this would have shattered the already cracked figures. Some were painted in oil colors, which became dull and discolored. In most cases the paint was removed at a later date. Traces of paint can be seen inside the pricked ears of this fox.

Messerschmidt sculpted them during the last thirteen years of his life, while apparently suffering from mental illness.This bust portrays a middle-aged man with a sour expression, which seems to fall somewhere between a grimace and a scowl. The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.This bust and the series it belongs to reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia.

As in images dating from the Middle Ages, Christ has long hair parted in the center and a beard and moustache, and his sunken cheeks make him appear gaunt. These wide eyes and the intense expression evoke the pathos of tradition devotional images of Christ being led to his death, mocked, scourged, and finally crucified.Meunier's loose, sketch-like handling of the bronze, however, is thoroughly modern, reminiscent of Auguste Rodin's manner. To suggest the horizontal arms of the cross, Meunier extended the shoulders out to the sides; he also detached at the wrist the left hand that crosses the chest, leaving it as a particularly evocative fragment. The bust's truncation is similarly radical, with a jagged, cut-off edge ending in a massive, irregular base. Artists in the 1800s came to use this kind of jagged truncation as a symbol for the alienated artist. Here Meunier applied the symbolic content of the jagged cut to a traditional religious representation, expressing the idea that Christ was cast out by those whom he would redeem.",H:  23 5/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13228401.jpg,Belgian,Bronze,Bust of Christ

Beyond the mill an ivy-covered steeple, a field, and a village are, by contrast, much more pale to establish atmospheric distance. Other details suggest the summer heat: Women are barefoot, a dog drinks water from the mill's stream, and cattle gravitate toward the shade.

The ancient Greeks considered the Delphic oracle--both Apollo's divine prophecy and the prophetess through whom it was spoken--the final authority on almost any matter, whether religious, political, or social.Camillo Miola merged academic andclassicaltraditions to construct his view of the classical past.

This bronze relief represents that moment, with the Virgin Mary and John flanking Jesus on either side of the cross and a weeping Mary Magdalene kneeling at the base. The artist emphasized the Virgin's close relationship to Jesus through their interlocking gazes and mirrored gestures. Both are modeled with three-quarter profile heads, and the Virgin's open arms, expressing her acceptance of the event, mimic those of Jesus. In contrast, John and Mary Magdalen are in profile, and their more overtly dramatic gestures convey their tremendous grief.Francesco Mochi designed the clouds and figures with foreshortening to suggest depth, a strategy that is only apparent when the relief is seen from below, as the artist intended.Features such as the relief's elongated rectangular shape, large size, gilding, keyhole, and hinge indicate that it served as the door of a tabernacle on the high altar of a church.

His exercises in different painting techniques are seen in the way he softened the outlines of forms and the manner in which he explored the descriptive possibilities of brushstrokes: broad and flat in the tablecloth, sketchy in the apples, and short and dense in the flower petals. Monet's technique is also apparent in the use of light to animate the surfaces of the flowers, fruit, and tablecloth and in the way the colors are affected by the light, by reflections, and by each other. These pictorial innovations became the foundation for the development of the Impressionist technique in the decades that followed.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00082801.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,Still Life with Flowers and Fruit

He said, ""For me a landscape hardly exists at all as a landscape, because its appearance is constantly changing; but it lives by virtue of its surroundings, the air and the light which vary continually.""After beginning outdoors, Monet reworked each painting in his studio to create the color harmonies that unify each canvas. The pinks in the sky echo the snow's reflections, and the blues of the wheatstacks' shadows are found in the wintry light shining on the stacks, in the houses' roofs, and in the snowy earth. With raised, broken brushstrokes, Monet captured nuances of light and created a solid, geometric structure that prevents the surface from simply melting into blobs.

Extending the building's encrusted stone surface to the richly varied impasto surface of his painting, he portrayed the cathedral perpetually re-emerging in the suffused light of early morning.Monet created several groups of paintings exploring the color, light, and form of a single subject at various times of day, but his Rouen Cathedral series was his most intense effort on a single site. He painted there in late winter in both 1892 and 1893, then reworked his thirty canvases from memory in the studio through 1894. He began this example in 1893, working in an improvised studio in the front room of a dressmaker's shop across from the cathedral.After creating a coherent ensemble, Monet selected twenty paintings that he considered ""complete"" and ""perfect,"" including this one, for an exhibition at his Paris dealer's gallery in May 1895.

The woman's head turns distractedly to one side and, though lacking in anatomical specificity, achieves a surprising degree of expression.The creation of this sculpture reveals the lengthy gestation period that sometimes accompanied Henry Moore's work. In the late 1950s, he made amaquetteor small plaster model of this seated figure. Once he had achieved the desired shape, one of Moore's studio assistants then carved a plaster mold of themaquetteto be sent to a foundry for casting in bronze. But Moore, unsatisfied with the large mold, chose not to have it cast and continued to refine the plaster. It remained in his studio for many years and was finally cast in 1975--more than two decades after the original design was conceived.","80 x 40 x 51 in., 1282 lb.",www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26555601.jpg,British,Bronze,Seated Woman

The mother's eyes--the only feature of her otherwise blank face--stare unblinkingly outward at the viewer. A rich, golden surface, punctuated by bright highlights and dark caverns, enhances the sculpture's warm, protective quality. The horizontal form's hollows and curves, tarnished and hatched to emphasize depth, partly transform the figure into a glimmering, rolling landscape.This work combines several themes that preoccupied Henry Moore: the reclining figure, the relationship of mother and child, and the landscape. Moore began exploring the reclining figure motif in a series of drawings he made in the late 1920s--nearly sixty years before creating this sculpture. Despite his continued interest in this subject, the sculptor resisted attaching any specific or symbolic meaning to it. Instead, he insisted that the reclining figure was simply a formal vessel--a pose he understood and greatly appreciated-- that allowed him to explore questions of form.","55 x 104 1/2 x 57 in., 2580 lb.",www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26555501.jpg,British,Bronze,Draped Reclining Mother and Baby

In the mid-1930s, Moore made a series of sketches based on carved wood figures from the South Pacific.

Soldiers always wore their sword on the opposite side of its primary use; thus this man's rapier, hanging from his right side, demonstrates that he is left-handed.The artist may have adopted this three-quarter-length, three-quarter-view format from Titian, who introduced the composition in military portraits in the 1530s.

MuybridgeThe possibility for moving pictures originated from a rich man's bet: whether or not a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at any time during its stride. Because the unaided eye cannot see such an instantaneous event, Leland Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to photograph his racehorse, Occidental. After Muybridge produced the proof to win the bet, he continued his motion experiments and documented them in this album. He wrote the above passage on the album's first page, describing his methodical approach of rigging twenty-four cameras with electromagnetic shutters--tripped by wires as an animal ran across a track.Photographs of the cameras show how wires were attached to modified lens shutters; others depict the racetrack, where a long shed with the battery of cameras faced a track with a wall behind to silhouette subjects.

Contending that all four of a horse's feet are off the ground simultaneously at some point while galloping, Stanford hired Muybridge to prove it photographically.Muybridge's first photographs of the horse were poorly exposed and thus inconclusive. After constructing a more efficient shutter and improving the speed of his film, he resumed his experiments with motion studies in 1877, but he was still producing only single images. Undaunted, he developed a system of first twelve and eventually twenty-four cameras, whose electro-magnetic shutter blades were opened by the stride of the animal tripping wires strung across the track. This series of twenty-four consecutive frames, which took less than one second to expose, was made after Muybridge had perfected his technique.

Nadar's portrait captured the sculptor's turbulent energy through the tense twist of the pose. Préault's body turns to his right, his head slightly to the left, and his eyes farther to his left. His folded arms wrap around his body, momentarily holding in check his considerable physical and intellectual power, the better to be unleashed.By using strong overhead diagonal light to shape the large dome of the head and to cast half the face into shadow, Nadar emphasized the gravity of Préault's presence.

Although her name is now obscure, she was a well-known poet in her day, highly praised by her peers.When Nadar photographed her, Desbordes-Valmore was sixty-eight. She came to the studio somewhat reluctantly, citing her age and ""the cruelty of the sun."" The resigned sadness of her weathered face bespoke not only climate but also the difficulties of her eventful life and the deaths of her brother, two sisters, two daughters, and most of her closest friends in recent years. Nadar focused the camera so carefully on her face and figure that the chair on which she sat and its shadow on the wall receded into the distance together.

He and Nadar had known each other from around the 1840s.At about the same time and from nearly the same angle as this photograph, Nadar made an undatedcaricatureof Augier. Both emphasize, and in the case of the caricature exaggerate, the shape of Augier's most salient feature, his prominent nose.

Given Dumas's popularity, this mounted edition print, signed and dedicated by him, was likely intended for sale.Dumas is represented as a lively, vibrant man. The self-restraint of his crossed hands, resting on a chair that disappears into the shadows, seems like an attempt to contain an undercurrent of boundless energy that threatened to ruin the necessary stillness of the pose and appears to have found an outlet through Dumas's hair.

Here his stern visage reflects the notably taciturn man who, although he taught drawing, rarely spoke to his students, correcting their work simply by retouching. The overall effect of self-contained if melancholy dignity, of a man who has survived adversity and is beholden to no one, accords well with contemporary descriptions of Barye.

The Paris catacombs were former underground quarries that were refitted to house skeletons. Nadar ventured into them to create an unprecedented series of photographs illuminated by flashlight. He used a magnesium lamp, visible in the lower right corner of the image.Six or seven million skeletons were interred in the catacombs; in this photograph, seemingly every one is accounted for. Only sixteen carefully stacked protruding skulls on the wall are clearly distinguishable at left, yet they are all that is needed to indicate what the blackened squares in the distance represent.Around the time that Nadar made this series of a hundred photographs in the catacombs, two of his beloved friends passed away. The photographer may have been exploring his own mortality when he embarked upon this series, but it was also a fashionable pursuit to descend into these macabre depths. In mid-nineteenth century Paris, there were four annual visiting days for the catacombs, at which time they were filled with curious onlookers.",8 7/8 x 7 1/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/04598201.jpg,French,Albumen print,View in the Catacombs

While in exile with Hugo and his family on Jersey, Vacquerie continued to write, grew the beard he wears in Nadar's portrait, and, having learned photography from Hugo's son Charles, made a series of photographs documenting the family and the local landscape. Thus for a short time Vacquerie was a photographer, one of the very few whom Nadar photographed.In order to compete with painted portraits, photographers of the 1850s and 1860s frequently employed artists to embellish their images. Nadar was not an exception in this practice, although few painted photographs from his studio have survived. In this example, variously dense layers of reddish-black ink cover almost the entire surface of the print, with the overall effect of coarsening the image. Although the ink has been skillfully applied, particularly in the hair and beard, the subtlety of expression around Vacquerie's eyes has been lost and the shape of his mouth distorted. The retoucher radically changed the shape of Vacquerie's left sleeve by painting out a billowing wrinkle in order to simplify the silhouette.

She was also a woman as renowned for her romantic liaisons as her writing; here she allowed Nadar to photograph her, devoid of coquettish charms but nevertheless a commanding presence.This portrait is a riot of textural surfaces. The sumptuous satin of Sand's gown and silken texture of her hair have a rich tactile presence. Her shimmering skirt melts into the velvet-draped support on which she leans, creating a visual triangle with the careful center part of her wavy hair. The portrait details the exquisite laces, beads, and buttons of her gown, but her face, the apex of the triangle, is out of focus.

For the photograph, a mirror reflected light back from the window to provide detail in the shadow area.During the 1800s, Hugo was thought to be France's greatest writer. He began to write while still a schoolboy, and his poetry was first published at twenty. His wildly popular novels soon followed. Hugo's troubled personal life, however, stood in sharp contrast to his successful career. His wife was conspicuously in love with another man, his favorite daughter drowned, and another went mad. A talented amateur artist, he was interested in photography and once contemplated illustrating a book of his poems with photographic negatives.

These beams, as well as a third vertical form, have pointed tops suggestive of spears. Positioned on top of these beams, a single horizontal beam demarcates the tent's top edge. This snake-like form also insinuates violence: its gaping mouth, sharp fangs, and bulging eyes suggest that within the tent lies danger.Isamu Noguchi originally created this form as a stage set for choreographer and dancer Martha Graham's 1950 productionJudith. This sculpture is one of three bronze casts made from the balsawood original that appeared on stage. Graham'sJudithwas based on the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. The widow Judith seduced and then decapitated the general Holofernes who was laying siege to her hometown. Noguchi's sculpture alludes to the tent in which Judith beheads Holofernes. The tent's phallic spears convey Holofernes' desire for Judith; the serpent form, the peril awaiting the doomed general.Noguchi created stage sets throughout his career. When working on a scenic design, he would often arrange the elements on a miniature stage. This allowed him to play with the formal and spatial relationships between the objects. Noguchi desired his three-dimensional forms to animate space and positively alter the viewer's experience of the environment.","108 x 109 x 54 in., 424 lb.",www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26553501.jpg,American,Bronze,The Tent of Holofernes

They combine the two traditional Athenian vase-decoration techniques: the older technique of black-figure, and red-figure, the technique that would gain popularity and continue to be used through the fourth century B.C. On a black-figure vase, silhouettes in black gloss are contrasted against the red-orange clay of the vessel. On a red-figure vase, the forms come from the red-orange color of the clay, and the space around them is filled in with black gloss.

The hymn for the feast of the Ascension begins below the miniature.The miniature's artist, Pacino di Bonaguida, was well known in Florence for his devotional paintings. Here he has focused attention on the figure of Jesus, who is isolated at the center of the image.

With its strainer spout, this jar would have been used for wine or any other liquid that might contain particles needing filtering.Most decoration on Mycenaean pottery consisted of extremely stylizedmotifsof marine or floral origin. Around 1400 B.C., however, artists, probably inspired by wall painting, developed a less common pictorial style of pottery decoration. Bulls were frequent subjects on this pictorial pottery, and the man grasping the bull by the horn on this jar may be a bull jumper. Bull jumping, a ritual performance that originated in the Minoan culture on Crete, involved literally grabbing the horns of a bull and somersaulting over its back. If this man was a bull jumper, the sphinx and the pomegranates may indicate an unsuccessful leap resulting in his death, since they had funerary connotations in later Greek art.Most Mycenaean pictorial pottery has been found in the eastern Mediterranean, especially onCyprus. In the 1300s and 1200s B.C., Mycenaean Greeks exerted a strong influence over Cyprus.

An actor costumed as a phlyax and holding a wreath stands before Dionysos. The god sits on a chair with a cloak wrapped around his legs holding aphiale, or offering dish, which contains three white objects, perhaps eggs. The term phlyax is used for both farces parodying the heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life and for the actors who performed them. These plays were popular in the 300s and 200s B.C. in the Greek colonies in Italy. The term phlyax probably derives from the Greek verb ""to swell"" and finds its meaning in the actor's costume of a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus.

When war threatened, Ulysses and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch him, knowing they had to trick him into revealing himself. Cunningly, they deposited a heap of gifts before the women: jewelry, clothes, and other finery, but also a sword and shield.

In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles. The scenes painted on the fronts of these vases showed episodes fromThe Adventures of Telemachus,one of the king's favorite books. The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Sèvres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the répareur, Étienne-Henry Bono.

For example, the depiction of a rider on this vase derived from the long-standing Greek use of the horse as a symbol of status and wealth. A painter's miscalculation on this vase sheds light on his creative process. On the front of the vase, the Phineus Painter first drew a set of lines marking out the panel for decoration. Then, he proceeded to paint the horse but found that the panel was too small and the horse's tail hung out over the edge.

The cup itself has a distinctive form with a deep bowl, a large foot with a tall, concave profile, and a thick ring joining the foot and the bowl. Scholars refer to cups with this combination of form and decoration as Chalkidian cups. The strikingly angular form of the foot has led some scholars to believe that the shape of the cup may have been derived from metal prototypes. Eyes decorate the exterior of all Chalkidian cups. In Greek thought, large, staring eyes had an apotropaic power, that is, they had the ability to ward off evil and danger. The painted eyes on this cup may have protected the drinker, or the frontal face may have represented an abbreviated mask connected withDionysos, the god of wine.Scholars do not know precisely where Chalkidian pottery was made. Inscriptions on some vases have letters in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece, but no vases have been found there, or anywhere outside Italy and the western Mediterranean.

For example, Piranesi put little effort into describing their hands and feet, which seem to end abruptly or break off altogether. The jagged parallel shading in the body adds energy but indicates his lack of concern for muscular detail.

This revolutionary technique, the cornerstone of Impressionism, helps to reveal how light and movement affect the perception of objects. Pissarro made the canvas a field of textures and movement; the character of the brushstroke varies according to the texture and form of the object it describes.

The palette of muted browns, blacks, greens, and blues create an autumnal landscape. The pale blue-gray sky, streaked with clouds, and the sparse foliage, both on and fallen from the almost bare trees, also convey winter's approach. A single figure and, in the distance, a figure and carriage, move along the desolate road curving through the scene.Camille Pissarro's landscape shows the road to the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye from Louveciennes, a village west of Paris. Many of Pissarro's landscapes of the early 1870s show the roads into and out of Louveciennes. Pissarro himself lived intermittently in Louveciennes and was part of a close-knit community of landscape painters who lived or traveled there including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.During the early 1870s, Pissarro began experimenting with the emerging Impressionist painting style by returning to watercolor, a medium he had used as a student during the 1850s. Using black chalk, Pissarro first indicated the main features of the composition. He then fleshed out the scene by covering almost the entire sheet with watercolor. Pissarro experimented with some of the spontaneous effects of watercolor, allowing it to pool and tide in some areas and applying it more evenly in others to create a diffuse light. He used broad, wet strokes to define the sky and smaller strokes, with more pigment on the brush, to articulate the foliage and figures.Also in the Getty's collection, the paintingHouses at Bougival (Autumn)was made by Pissarro about one year before this drawing. Although they depict similar subjects, the two works explore different effects.

The full-length figure on the recto served as a source for the putto at the painting's top right.The kneeling figure on the verso was a study for the young John the Baptist, who appears in the same general pose at the painting's center and also looks upward.

Pontormo made this drawing as a preparatory study for a scene of the martyrdom of Saint Lawrencefor theCertosa del Galluzzo, a monastery outside Florence. However, it was Pontormo's pupil Bronzino who executed the finished fresco.Saint Lawrence is usually depicted as a young man. According to legend, Lawrence was a third-century Roman deacon who was responsible for distributing goods to the poor. When a greedy high-ranking official demanded that Lawrence give him the church's treasure, Lawrence presented a group of poor people, saying that they were the church's treasure. For this defiant act, he was arrested and tortured on a burning gridiron.  In the finished work, Bronzino made only small changes to Pontormo's composition.  Bronzino's figure lies on a gridiron and turns his head to the left, as he is crowned by a cherub. He holds a palm leaf in his left hand, an emblem of martyrdom.

From the very first day, I was overwhelmed by the scenery--both in prospect and in description grossly underrated. The monumental structure of the towering walls in variety and color defied comprehension.--Eliot PorterEliot Porter made his first rafting trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon in 1960. He became captivated by the region's beauty, and over the next decade, returned to it ten times to photograph its weathered trees, colorful rock formations, and hidden slit canyons. This image of a sheer sandstone wall in vivid shades of salmon and purple demonstrates Porter's keen observation of the region's unique beauty.In the early 1960s, the Sierra Club was in the middle of a campaign to stop construction of a hydroelectric plant on the Colorado River at Glen Canyon. Its director thought a book of Porter's photographs might be persuasive. Porter had already collaborated with the environmental organization on a publication that earned critical praise. In 1963, the Sierra Club and Porter published the bookThe Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.Copies were sent to President John F. Kennedy and members of Congress. That same year, construction of the Glen Canyon Dam was completed, creating Lake Powell and flooding hundreds of miles of the river and its tributary canyons. Porter's Glen Canyon photographs became especially meaningful in the aftermath of the dam's construction, as a record of a lost national treasure. Glen Canyon lacked national park status and protection because it was ""the place no one knew.""

But the most striking contribution to Iceland's plant life is its mosses.--Eliot PorterA consistent thread in Eliot Porter's photography is his scientific attention to detail; his ability to observe what often goes unnoticed.

At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free.

The ordered composition and clear, golden light contribute toA Calm'sutter tranquility, while glowing, gem-like colors and fluid paint strokes enliven this scene of benevolent nature. Poussin's sketching campaigns in the Roman countryside with his friend and fellow landscape painter Claude Lorrain account, in part, for its fresh observation of cloud-scattered sky and grazing goats.Poussin painted a pendant to this painting,Landscape with a Storm,now in a museum in Rouen.

She stands with her right hand modestly covering her pubic area while her left hand drops her garment on a vase. Her eyes were originally inlaid in a contrasting material, and she would have worn earrings.This Roman statuette copies on a smaller scale one of the most famous Greek statues ever made. About 350 B.C. the Greek sculptor Praxiteles carved a cult statue of the goddessAphrodite, the first full-scale female nude in Greek art. Praxiteles' statue became extremely popular, especially in theHellenisticand Roman periods, capturing the attention of both writers and artists. Although the original statue does not survive, its popularity led to a huge production of copies and variations on the theme, so that today more nude Aphrodites survive than any other single ancient statue type.The idea of the goddess caught in a private moment follows a certain voyeuristic tradition in Hellenistic art, and part of the statue's appeal was clearly erotic. The gesture of the goddess's right hand is ambiguous, drawing attention to her pubis and concealing it at the same time.

On this cup, these techniques are joined by an extensive use of added-clayrelief. Thus, the lyre on side A has arms and a cross-piece painted in added color, much of which has flaked off, incised strings, and a raised sound box added in clay (now chipped). The leftmost youth sits on a camp stool which the artist added in clay relief. It has white hinges and is topped by what was once a red cushion. The surface of what was once apparently a brightly colored vase, perhaps enhanced withgilding, is now the beige color of the clay.",4 5/16 x 10 13/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/01415101.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,"Wine Cup with a Gathering of Men, Youths, and Women"

Looking bewildered, a second old man clasps the child's wrist. This strange scene probably represents a theatrical parody of the mythical birth of Erichthonios. In the myth, Hephaistos, the craftsman god, believing that the goddess Athena was attracted to him, attempted to have sex with her. When she resisted, some ofHephaistos'ssemen fell on her leg. She wiped it off with a piece of wool and threw it away, accidentally impregnating Ge, the earth. Athena cared for the resulting infant and kept him in a sacred basket on the Athenian Akropolis. In the theatrical version depicted on this vase, the elaborate doorway at the left of the stage probably representsAthena'stemple, and the ram's head on the child refers to the wool in the story.The scene on the front of thisApulianred-figurebell-krater depicts a phlyax play, a type of farce parodying mythology, popular in the Greek colonies in South Italy in the 300s B.C.

He clearly demonstrated the man's stern admonishment as he turns to face the woman's darkened gaze. Concentrating on both faces and the man's hands--the carriers of the drama--Rembrandt used only a few calligraphic strokes to describe the pair's clothing and give them a sense of three-dimensionality. He also engaged the paper, making the blank areas as active in describing the scene as the lines themselves. Even in a rapid sketch, Rembrandt created a sense of narrative, drama, and character.Rembrandt may have depicted an early event in the Old Testament story of the prophet Samuel.

A fine dotting technique further animates this area, giving the sense of a slight breeze passing across the treetops.

Adopting some aspects of the extremely precise manner of these miniatures--so unlike his usual loose, evocative style of draftsmanship--Rembrandt nonetheless enlivened the figures' poses by giving them more sense of action than did the Mughal style. Despite their looseness, his lines present the figures in the three-quarter body and profile head view common in Indian painting.A contemporary of Rembrandt known for his building campaigns and as a patron of art, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan is recognizable from his characteristic dress and face--and the aureole, which distinguished portrayals of Mughal rulers beginning with his father's reign.

This story of Daniel's dramatic exposure of the king's idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel.Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the king's grandeur with Daniel's humility. Facing out and gesturing toward the table, the lavishly attired Cyrus appears large and imposing.

Sebastiano Ricci took this subject from Livy'sHistory of Rome,first published in A.D. 14, but he showed Navius cutting a column, a more aesthetic object.Ricci pared the composition down to its dramatic essentials--two large figures making eloquent gestures--and added a recognizable setting and bystanders to create a sense of community. The slightly shadowed mother and child is a typical Ricci motif. Effectively employing the usual Roman Baroque sense of dramatic light and color, he adopted Giovanni Battista Gaulli's strong, rather hot colors for the costumes and the sky.

The study of ancient Greece and Rome was quite popular at the time, and Riccio combined a refined knowledge of antiquity with the Christian present, much to the delight of his contemporaries.

Displaying the restless nature typical of small children, the infant Christ twists away from his mother to face the viewer.ThoughVirgin and Childwas originally a full-length statue, only the upper half now survives. Because the figures' heads are angled downward, scholars believe that Riccio made the sculpture as the devotional centerpiece of a raised altar. Now largely stripped of color,Virgin and Childwas once vibrantly painted. Originally, both figures had dark brown hair and pale skin.

The skull and hourglass, common symbols of the temporality of man and his creations, suggest that the building itself represents fallen greatness. Hubert Robert emphasizes the ruins' immensity by contrasting the small figures with the structure's massive columns. In the left foreground, a column shrouded in darkness runs nearly the full height of the composition. Birds roosting in the upper reaches of the lofty barrel vault reinforce the impression of the monument's vast dimensions.This small cabinet picture is one of several versions of the subject depicted by Robert beginning in the 1760s. In each of them, a monk prays beside a brick wall that has been built within the arcades of a Roman ruin. For this imaginary basilica, Robert likely drew inspiration from a contemporary print by Giovanni Battista Piranesi.",22 3/4 x 27 3/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00091801.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,A Hermit Praying in the Ruins of a Roman Temple

The director of the French Academy in Rome encouraged students to make the Italian capital and its environs one of their favored subjects.Hubert Robert created this drawing while a student at that academy. It explicitly embodies a theme that remained constant throughout his career: the interaction between living nature and aged, slightly decaying buildings. He brought many such drawings back to Paris, where they served as sources for his paintings for many years.Robert typically developedcompositionswhose effect was both picturesque and slightly imposing. This scene, drawn in red chalk, one of his favorite media, combines direct observation with the artist's imagination.

2007.4,Hubert Robert,1806,"Under a bright, sun-drenched sky, the demolition of the château of Meudon is well under way. In the lower left, a man in a top hat directs four laborers--one clearly shirking his responsibilities. Other workmen transport stones with wheelbarrows or by hand. At center, two women and a young girl admire the ruins. Other visitors have entered the structure and gaze out from a balcony. Another young woman, holding a baby, tends to a group of children playfully lugging a cart across the littered courtyard. At the right edge, an artist with a large sheet of paper on his lap, gestures at the scene below.This diverse human activity--encompassing work, rest, and play--is dwarfed by the château itself, which although partly demolished, creates a strong diagonal axis through the composition. Hubert Robert also emphasizes the main structure by casting it in strong light. By contrast, many of the figures around the periphery of the composition are shrouded in shadow.Located near Versailles, with a view of Paris and the Seine River, the château of Meudon was once among France's finest monuments. But during the 1700s, it fell into disrepair. During the French Revolution, which began in 1789, the château was ransacked and it suffered further damage in a fire of 1795. It was demolished entirely in 1803. Rather than documenting the site's actual appearance in that year, Hubert Robert combined fact and fiction, depicting features that had already vanished alongside still-existing elements of the structure.",44 1/2 x 57 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26530201.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,Demolition of the Château of Meudon

He was a crossing-sweeper. I should never have accomplished one of my best works if I had not seen him sitting at a table in my studio, waiting, till I could talk to him. I not only saw the old man there, but mentally, the old lady, and the interior of the cottage...The old man, by his attitude and expression, gave the germ of the idea; the old lady had to be found, and the cottage built, but they appeared to me then quite visibly and solidly.When Day's Work is Doneexists in more copies than any other photograph by Robinson.

2008.60,Auguste Rodin,1898 - 1900,"In ancient mythology, the sphinx embodies an amalgam of human, lion, and hawk body parts. The subject of this watercolor by Auguste Rodin, titled Sphinx, doesn't literally represent such a beast. Instead, the artist drew a young woman, who is standing frontally, with her arms folded.Rodin made this drawing late in his life, during a period of prodigious output. As is common in those drawings, sketchy pentimento lines appear to suggest a figure in motion. Here, though, the scribbly pencil marks may indicate that the model was partially clothed, because of the artist's inscription, ""noir draperie"" (black drapery).Rodin usually sketched his models without taking his eyes off the figure or looking down at the sheet of paper. In this case, the artist first incised the figure's silhouette--notably the hips and elbows--before using the pencil or the brush. Although the figure appears hastily sketched, the drawing as a whole reflects Rodin's considerable abilities as a draftsman. Details, such as the model's perfectly turned right ankle and knee, belie his considerable skills of observation. Carefully applied watercolor washes reveal Rodin's mastery of technique.Like many nineteenth-century artists, Rodin was interested in exotic subjects. Subtle clues, such as sand beneath the woman's feet and a palm tree on the horizon imply that, like the Great Sphinx of Giza, this woman is set in a time-forgotten, romanticized place. Rodin's title implies on a metaphorical level that she--or ""woman"" more generally--is like the sphinx, an enigmatic creature.",19 x 12 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31363101.jpg,French,Brown wash and graphite,Sphinx

On discovering that the chief god Jupiter had impregnated the young mortal Semele, his wife Juno hatched a plan to end their love affair. Disguised as Semele's nurse, and knowing that Jupiter's lightning and thunder were lethal, she persuaded Semele to ask Jupiter to visit ""in all his glory."" Here, as Semele gives birth to Bacchus, who is caught by nymphs, as she herself is consumed by flames. From the top of the clouds, Juno looks apprehensively at her thunderbolt-carrying husband.Giulio Romano and his workshop originally painted this scene as part of an erotic series of mythological love stories for Federico Gonzaga, duke of Mantua.

On the left, holding a large key, is Janus, the guardian of the doorways of houses and city gates. He is traditionally portrayed with two faces, demonstrating his ability to look both ways at once. In the center, the bearded figure of Chronos personifies Time. In one hand he holds a scythe, while a snake gripping its tail in its mouth wraps itself around his neck. Such a snake holding its tail was an ancient Egyptian symbol of eternity. Gaea, the goddess of the Earth, crouches at Chronos's feet with another snake grasped in her right hand. The winged figure of Victory, her hair streaming out to the side, stands behind these three and holds out a crown in her left hand.Giulio Romano made this drawing in preparation for part of the frescoed vault of the Sala dei Giganti (Room of the Giants) in the Palazzo del Te, the summer residence of the court of Giulio's patron, Federico Gonzaga, duke of Mantua.

Thus Jupiter's godly presence set Semele's frail human body on fire. After Giulio Romano completed this preparatory drawing, it was squared so that his assistants could copy it onto another surface. Inventories show that Giulio made a painting with a similar subject for the ducal palace in Mantua to celebrate the birth of a  Gonzaga prince in 1533, the son of Giulio's patron Federico Gonzaga.

With the help of a companion, Hercules finally killed the creature by cauterizing the necks with a burning torch. Giulio Romano showed Hercules resting triumphant, with the hydra heads strewn around his feet. He holds his club under one arm and grasps the end of a torch in the other, while his bow and quiver of arrows hang from the tree behind.This drawing does not relate to any known work.

The Getty Museum's example can be dated to about 1758 because one of the movement's springs is inscribed with this date.Scholars believe that Charles Cressent, one of the greatestébénistesof the 1700s, designed the elaborate gilt bronze and enameled metal case of this clock. Stringent guild regulations prohibited Cressent from gilding and chasing this design himself as he was a cabinetmaker and not a member of the bronze caster's guild.

Striding across a cloud and holding an open book, the figure looks upward as if receiving a sacred message. Swirling strokes defining his tousled hair contrast with the parallel lines used to shade the wings. The figure's expressive movement and gesture, captured in a characteristic Mannerist contrapposto pose, effectively convey an unearthly power.Though the drawing is not associated with any known painting, scholars believe it was made as a preparatory study for a larger project. Three studies of a male nude falling on his back, drawn on the verso of the sheet, provide a clue about this possible undertaking. The verso studies show how Roncalli worked out his composition forThe Conversion of St. Paul, a fresco he executed at a chapel in Rome in 1586. It is possible that the angel was drawn for the same chapel; however, large sections of the painting are now missing due to damage and deterioration.

When commercial exploitation threatened the forest, Rousseau wrote to the Duke of Morny, an influential politician close to Napoleon III, to urge the preservation of the forest.During the summer Rousseau made use of a special easel and lean-to to facilitate painting outdoors.

According to Greek legend, Medea, a princess of the foreign kingdom of Colchis, was married to Jason, who eventually left her to marry a native Greek woman. A passionate and jealous woman, Medea stopped at nothing to obtain revenge, including murdering her own children.

Drawn in luminous light brown ink, the principal figure demonstrates the muscular structure of the back, buttocks, and legs. Fascinated with the structure of the human body, Peter Paul Rubens then drew two subsidiary views of the same powerful form and a detail of the left arm from a different angle.Rubens produced this drawing sometime during an eight-year stay in Italy, and it shows the strong influence of the new approaches he learned there. The skillfully drawn forms show his complex grasp of the human body in three dimensions. The main figure's truncated right arm suggests the artist's study of brokenantiquestatues, while the surging, heroically proportioned forms and the extensive hatching of the musculature display his familiarity with Michelangelo's drawings. Scholars believe that Rubens produced this anatomical drawing in preparation for an instructional book on human anatomy, which he never published.

The ferocious creature--seemingly undaunted by a pair of hounds latched onto its bristled hide--has turned to confront head-on its human adversary. Meleager's blow will prove to be fatal to the boar, but the beast has proven itself as a fearsome foe. Beneath its imposing hooves lie the disemboweled carcass of a hound and the prostrate corpse of the hunter, Ancaeus.The story of the Calydonian boar hunt was told and retold during antiquity--most famously inOvid'sMetamorphoses.When King Oeneus of Calydon failed to honor the goddess Diana with offerings, she released a terrifying boar on his land. The king's son, Meleager, assembled a group of renowned warriors to slay the beast. Several of the huntsmen were killed or maimed before Meleager finally defeated the boar. He presented its head as a trophy to his beloved, the huntress Atalanta, who is seen behind Meleager, with bow in hand.Peter Paul Rubens created this painting a few years after an extended stay in Italy. He drew from ancientsarcophagiand statues he had seen there for the poses of many of the figures. For example, the boar seen in profile was taken directly from a well-known marble in Florence's Uffizi Gallery. Rubens's appropriation of iconic images fromantiquitywas intended to resonate with learned viewers. For the figures on horseback, Rubens borrowed from hisRenaissancepredecessors, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. But Rubens's dynamic and inventive interpretation of the hunt was wholly his own. With this painting, he established the theme of the epic combat between man and animal, a subject to which he would return throughout his career.",23 1/4 x 35 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/26759901.jpg,Flemish,Oil on panel,The Calydonian Boar Hunt

Christ's tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christ's side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.This painting was probably made to serve as analtarpiecein a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist.

He then used whitebodycolorto suffuse the onlookers in theChristChild's miraculous holy light, a concept ultimately derived from Correggio's art.In this sheet, Rubens's drawing betrays an artist who thinks primarily as a painter, softening outlines and building up shapes that then take on life and color. Even in this very finished drawing, he characteristically sacrificed detail to gain a sense of movement and energy.For twenty-five years, Rubens supplied his boyhood friend Balthasar Moretus, head of Antwerp's Plantin Press, with illustrations for books ranging from the philosophy of Seneca to a treatise on optics.

The Charles Minot steam engine was thrown from the tracks as the result of an attack by the Confederate cavalry. During the American Civil War, one of the earliest wars to be extensively photographed, much of the Union Army's efforts was directed at rebuilding bridges and railroads destroyed by retreating Confederate forces. This experience working on railroad projects was a great aid to the nation in later years, when countless well-trained Civil War veterans worked on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. Grenville Dodge, chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad and former General in the Union Army, remarked favorably upon the abilities of former soldiers who undertook backbreaking railroad work: ""It was the war that taught them how to think big, how to organize grand projects, how to persevere.""",9 1/4 x 12 13/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/10522801.jpg,American,Albumen print,Railroad Accident Caused by Rebels

In his hand he casually holds a black hat lined with glowing white satin. Gregory's hat and collar are covered with white powder from his fashionably dressed hair. He is somberly yet richly dressed, alert yet seated at ease. Gregory's decorous pose embodies Russell's ideal of depicting the sitter in a manner appropriate to his age.The portrait's brilliant whites, velvety blacks, and masterful interplay of varied flesh tones with blues are all characteristics of Russell's virtuoso application ofpastel. Russell achieved the even tonality by manually smudging broad, soft areas of crayon onto the paper. He then applied fine, linear flourishes, such as the white highlighting on the cravat and in the hat lining, with a hard, pointed crayon.

In the distance, the delicate bare branches of the trees create black tracery against the pale sky, their round tops echoing the curve of the bridges below and arc of birds overhead.Although Rutgers used both copies and his imagination as sources for his drawings, he drew this quintessential Dutch winter genre scene from life. It is one of two drawings the artist did of the same location on different occasions. Rutgers effectively captures the chill of a winter day with crisp pen work, particularly visible in the architectural details, contrasting against the expanse of white paper and gentle grey and brown washes in the sky and bank of snow.Jisp banned construction of new thatch roofs in 1647 as a precautionary measure. The drawing can therefore be dated before 1664, when a significant fire damaged the city, and likely destroyed any thatched roofs in the city. Close observation also reveals that Rutgers used a slightly different ink to draw the figures on the left than the rest of the drawing, suggesting that he was not satisfied with his original composition and added to it at a later time.",7 5/8 x 12 1/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/31356501.jpg,Dutch,Pen and brown and black ink and brown and grey wash,A Street in Jisp on a Winter's Day

But artists did not always have the opportunity to work from life and sometimes relied on stuffed animals or the work of their contemporaries as models.

On one deck is the stoic Roman general Regulus, commanding his followers as they attempt to board an enemy ship. Opposing Regulus is the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar Barca, father of the famed general Hannibal. In fanciful reference to Hannibal, the Carthaginian prows are elephant heads armed with imposing ramming tusks.Gabriel Jacques de Saint-Aubin meticulously described every detail of the foreground ships. He first drew the composition in black chalk and then used pen and ink to further articulate details of the ships, such as their masts and riggings, and the myriad figures. Using a limited palette of deftly applied watercolor--gray, brown, and blue--Saint-Aubin sensitively colored the sea and sky.The first Punic War (264-241 BC) was a conflict largely fought at sea. Involving over three hundred vessels, the battle depicted here was one of the largest navel battles in history. The smaller Roman fleet defeated the Carthaginian by dividing their forces into four squadrons and waging four separate battles.This drawing is one of a series of illustrations Saint-Aubin made in the 1760s for an ambitious history of Rome.

He created this self-portrait with a Polaroid camera, but he did not let the picture develop on its own. Samaras altered the print by manipulating the dyes, slightly obscuring his head and shoulders. The viewer's attention focuses on his gaping mouth, which suggests a long, desperate scream. Perhaps Samaras was trying to convey that he is frightened. Is he crying out in despair, or pain, or rage? Or is he crying out at all?

Samaras, a hermit-like person, made many Polaroid self-portraits like this in the 1970s as a means of observing himself. The images are open to a wide range of interpretation.

A picture of a life-size skeletal human is the third figure in the composition. Samaras's self-portraits are psychologically complex images that challenge viewers and defy any single interpretation.

Germany in the mid-1920s experienced political and economic chaos. By posing a woman with her child in a landscape, Sander emphasized women's domestic role and tie to nature rather than their increasing political and wage-earning power.

Joseph is modeled with subtle twists in his body, amplified by his buoyant and billowing tunic and cloak. Even his curly hair flutters with a life of its own. Fashioned from white-bodied earthenware, known as creamware, the figures are painted with lustrous jewel-like colors. Their theatricality is characteristic of Baroque sculpture.Athough most depictions present Saint Joseph as elderly, he is portrayed here as a youthful and handsome father. Inspired by the new focus on Jesus' human and family life and encouraged by the philosophies of the Counter-Reformation, the cult of Saint Joseph became more popular in the second half of the 1700s, when this sculpture was made.The subject and composition of this work are identical to those of a life-size marble of 1790 to 1791 by the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino in the Taranto Cathedral. Sanmartino produced a number of terracotta sketches for his large-scale sculpture; this small-scale ceramic group by Gennaro Laudato probably copied one of these and was intended as a collector's object or devotional piece.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00142101.jpg,Italian,Creamware,Saint Joseph with the Christ Child

Scenes like this one, drawn from Greek and Roman mythology, were popular in the 1600s and 1700s in France. By representing classical subjects, patrons and artists could justify depictions of the female nude and titillating images of amorous activity.

His attention to detail is especially evident in the thin gold seams in Mary's cloak, the jeweled crown, and the figures' fine facial features. In thebackground, an angel holds the crown and scepter. Since the 1500s, Schongauer has been credited with bringing the advances of NetherlandishRenaissanceart to Germany.

Forceful strokes of the pen delineate the rough texture of the wolf's shaggy coat, its alert stance, and panting expression. The thicker lines around its tail and belly suggest the softer furry tufts. Scorza probably drew the animals from life, closely observing their positions and expressions. Scorza drew at least four versions of this wolf, both with and without the doves. Both strong draftsmanship and a direct, unsentimental attitude distinguish this drawing.

She is plain, though not severe, with pulled back bun and slightly thick features--an unassuming motherly personage, apparently unaware that she is being observed. The drawing possesses an almost mystical aura, combining extreme intimacy and proximity with the equally extreme interiority of the sitter's facial expression. Her puzzling physical presence and psychological stillness is made all the more vaporous and ghostly by the drawing technique Seurat called ""irradiation,"" which avoided distinct lines and represented the subtleties of light and shadow through tones of black crayon.The drawing was surely full of meaning for mother and son.

This nearly abstract drawing, with its complete lack of edges among the forms, is a study in the pure interaction of light and shadow.When Seurat returned to Paris in 1880, he spent two years drawing in only black and white. This choice allowed him to explore the phenomenon of light's interpenetration and reflection. While absorbed in his preoccupation with gradation and contrast rather than line, he soon mastered the balance of massing light and dark.

Rather than drawing individual lines, he rubbed roughly textured paper with greasy Conté crayon, creating a large shadowy mass. By combining various densities of crayon--darker for the figure, light and feathery for the background--Seurat explored a concept he called ""irradiation.""

This technique encourages the viewer to consider words and letters in new ways. The title of this sculpture suggests that it represents an outer garment or covering for a figure rather than a figure itself. The bronze's hollow form supports such a reading.

Sodoma focused on these facial expressions to emphasize the peace of God, even amidst suffering.Sodoma used a highly elaborate technique to draw this scene, with considerable white heightening to create painterly effects for both the faces and the garments of the figures. He drew the Resurrection on the verso in a more calm, classical manner with a more linear technique. Brush and brown ink delineate Christ's muscular body as he emerges from the edge of the tomb with one foot still inside.

Roman emperors revered individual gods, and Augustus's patron god was Apollo. Augustus believed Apollo secured victory for his forces in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C: Solon carved other images of Augustus and members of the Imperial family in the guise of deities.Look closely and you will notice that the image is carved into the gem--a technique known asintaglio--to create a sense of depth.

In this moralizing painting, Steen commented on the foolishness of human behavior.Bathsheba's robe is casually arranged to reveal her breast and bare legs.

The overall darkness of the print heightens the picture's drama, while the contrasting highlight areas of shirt collar and brush tip create a tonal balance within the composition.

A piece of light-sensitive paper was taped at the back of the camera obscura. The reflection of the building was registered on the paper, which produced this sketchy negative image of the building. Talbot conducted these light-sensitivity experiments from mid-1834 until the summer of 1835.

Teske was there to photograph the architect, Taliesin's buildings and grounds, and Wright's apprentices. The creative atmosphere that Teske encountered there made a profound impression on him that lasted throughout his life.For more than three decades beginning in 1940, Teske spent time working on this montage, which represents Wright's achievements. Teske layered and tore his prints and re-photographed them.

The seated woman in the lower right is Wright's third wife, Olgivanna. Wright himself floats above a landscape of dilapidated looking traditional architecture and images of ordinary Americans whom Teske saw as symbolic of society.This collage reflects Teske's internalization of the architect's philosophy. Wright had rejected the ornate style of traditional architecture in favor of sleek, simple lines and natural materials. His organic style emphasized the spiritual and symbiotic ties between nature and architecture.

What is most noticeable is the pattern of elongated holes that puncture the strip in intervals. These punched holes are obviously manmade; they appear too regularly spaced and square-shaped to be caused by the branches that the paper is snagged on.This image was part of a series of studies that Teske made of his hometown, Chicago, in which he documented the rundown industrial environment on the city's South Side during the late 1930s. This strip of paper once had a purpose: It generated music from a pianola, or player piano, whose keys performed the notes coded as holes in the paper. Now discarded, it could be imagined that a wind gusting across the prairie might cause a soft whistling sound as it passes through the holes.

93.XM.5.6,Edmund Teske,1939,"At first glance, the subject of this photograph is difficult to identify, but the pattern of holes arranged in concentric circles gives it away. To emphasize the deteriorated state of this kitchen sieve, Edmund Teske combined several experimental darkroom techniques to make this one-of-a-kind print.Teske employed solarization-a process by which some black and white tones are reversed by exposure to light during the development process-and chemical staining, in which the exposed print is alternately developed and exposed to light. The solarization enhances the sieve's unique patterning as well as the blocks of light that draw attention to its form and the blades of grass poking through its eroded bottom. The print's chemical stains and streaks, ranging from reddish-browns to vivid blues, create streaks and colors that evoke the rusting and cracking of the sieve.Teske made this negative in Chicago in 1939 and returned to it many years later to make the print. He did not use traditional toners in his photography. Instead he devised his own duotone solarization technique in the late 1950s, which he applied here. For him, this style of darkroom manipulation resulted in a more organic look in keeping with his philosophy of life. Through his study of Vedantic Hinduism and the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, Teske felt a strong connection to nature. By choosing a decaying object as his subject and by reworking an old negative, Teske underscored his belief in the cyclical nature of time; that life-forms go through periods of disintegration and rebirth.",11 x 13 15/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/10599501.jpg,American,Gelatin silver duotone solarized print,Sieve in Deterioration

Mrs. Soakup gave music lessons and operated the studio, which was built next to the Soakup's suburban Chicago home. Teske was probably drawn to these objects because music was one of his passions: He took saxophone lessons and learned to play the piano in his youth.This image also reflects Teske's more prosaic documentary approach during a period in which he aimed to make a ""portrait"" of his hometown. Teske was always drawn to subjects that were more personal to him, especially the environments of people he felt close to. This photograph has an intimate, candid feel to it because of its composition, in which the selection of carefully arranged objects are thrown slightly off-balance by the randomly stacked books and papers to the left.

The image reflects Teske's outlook on human identity, particularly his own fluid approach to sexuality and the idea that a person can embody both masculine and feminine qualities.Soft light draws attention to the youth's curly hair and lithe body, which form a visual contrast to the man's work he is engaged in: repairing a car and getting dirty. For Teske, the male body was as worthy of idealization as the female nude. Soakup is portrayed in a candid way that evokes his sexuality and their intimacy.After moving from Chicago-where this picture was made-to Los Angeles, Teske studied a branch of Eastern philosophy, Vedantic Hinduism, that supported his progressive outlook on human identity.

At the second stage of development, the print reacted to the light and changed color from gray to russet, brown, and reddish brown in a process Teske called duotone solarization.

Horsemen symbolizing divine wrath trample everything beneath them, as angels blow trumpets to unleash natural disasters.To make this composite print, Edmund Teske combined two negatives-the portrait of his friend and a copy of a Gustave Doré engraving illustrating the work of Anger's favorite poet, John Milton. In the epic poem,Paradise Lost, the fallen angel Satan wages war on heaven. This image illustrates a section called ""Pandaemonium,"" literally meaning ""all demons"" or hell.Teske made this photograph after years of experimentation with various forms of darkroom manipulation. It exemplifies his later style but also suggests Anger's multilayered, ""psychedelic"" approach to filmmaking.

Hanging clothes soften this stark industrial world, and the woman's closed eyes and thoughtful expression set a contemplative mood.Teske photographed the landscape in 1940 in a steel industry shantytown on the outskirts of Chicago. The image is sandwiched with a 1956 negative portraying Shirley Berman, the wife of Wallace Berman, a Beat movement artist and poet. Both were friends of Teske in Los Angeles; he often used Shirley's portrait in composite pictures as an archetypal female figure.For Teske, printing old negatives had a nostalgic and symbolic function.

He seems aware of being photographed but relaxed and contemplative as he stands in the doorway of his Topanga Canyon studio.Teske and Herms became good friends in the 1960s and shared many ideas about life and art-particularly a fascination for abandoned objects marked by the passage of time.

The other band members-Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore-are gathered next to Morrison and surround a rather totemic-looking bust of Ludwig van Beethoven on a table.While this is a fairly typical-looking band portrait, Teske made it seem far less conventional by superimposing another image with it. The second picture is a close-up of an old and cracked vinyl seat cushion.

But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it.

Other characters, also wearing masks, stand around watching the scene, preparing a chair for the weary Punchinello and fetching an umbrella.Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo produced this drawing as part of a series of 103 works dealing with specific episodes in the life of Punchinello, entitledDivertimento per li ragazzi(Diversions for Children). The scenes, whose themes range from amusement to tragedy, illuminate the complex character of the hunchbacked fool. As a testament to Tiepolo's fondness for this subject, he decorated his family home, Villa Ziani, with images from the series.Tiepolo sketched the drawing first in black chalk, which was easy to change, before drawing in the figures with pen, ink, and brown wash. The numerous black chalk lines that still remain suggest that the artist made several changes to the design before he settled on this scene.",13 15/16 x 18 1/2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00006401.jpg,Italian,"Pen and brown ink, brown wash, and black chalk",Punchinello Is Helped to a Chair
86.DA.535,Jean-Baptiste Tilliard,1750 - 1760,"Jean-Baptiste Tilliard made this unusually large bed for a bedroom in a grand private residence. The bed would have been placed sideways against a wall, with a draped baldachin, now missing, above. The large wheels allowed servants to pull out the body of the bed easily, leaving the tall back attached to the wall while they made it up. It was probably set into an alcove or niche in the bedroom wall.In eighteenth-century France, a bed of this shape was called alit à la turque(Turkish bed) because of its two scrolling ends. This title does not refer to any specific Turkish design source but reflects the eighteenth-century preoccupation with anything exotic and unusual from foreign countries. Turkey, China, and Egypt were among the places that inspired craftsmen in their creation ofromanticand luxurious interiors. The intention was not to accurately recreate foreign objects but to impart a feeling of exotic opulence, even if only through the name attached to an object. The fashion for things ""Turkish"" peaked in the middle of the 1700s, whenMadame de Pompadourhad a bedroom that was known as thechambre à laturque(Turkish bedroom) only because the paintings displayed in the room showed a slave girl presenting a cup of tea to a sultaness.",5 ft. 8 1/2 in. x 8 ft. 8 1/4 in. x 6 ft. 2 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00677801.jpg,French,Two-tonedgildedbeechwood; modern silk upholstery,Bed (Lit à la Turque)

The woman holds a basket filled with standard funerary offerings: ribbons, wreaths, andaryballoi, a type of small oil vessel. The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.",14 x 2 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/01286401.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,Oil Jar with a Woman Carrying a Basket of Offerings

Each figure sits at a sharp diagonal angle, as though it had been twisted and compressed within the confines of the page and was trying to break free. Atlas's contorted position increases the overall sense of energy and muscular strength. Although each figure's position remains nearly the same, Tintoretto subtly varied the surface shading throughout.

His confident strokes of black chalk define the sensuous curves of her body, while quickly-drawn white chalk lines add texture and substance to her form. In this sketch, Tintoretto also explored different ways to position his model on paper. This is most visible in her face, where the outlines of two poses overlap.Tintoretto probably made this sketch for future use in a mythologicalcomposition, as both the woman's pose and form resemble the figure of the goddessVenusin contemporary Venetian artworks.

Dressed in armor with a diminutive page looking up to him, Alfonso d'Avalos exudes the tremendous power he wielded as governor of Milan and commander general of imperial forces in Italy under the Holy Roman Emperor,Charles V. As the Abbot of Brantôme--a French historian--observed, Avalos was a man who took great care with his appearance. He was born into an illustrious Spanish-Neapolitan family and trained for a military career under his cousin, Ferdinando Francesco, the Marchese di Pescara. After winning numerous military campaigns, Avalos was honored with theOrder of the Golden Fleece. He is shown wearing the Order's royal collar over an elaborate and beautifully wrought suit of armor befitting an imperial leader. In the lower left, his page hands him a helmet. Titian, who may have known Avalos personally, endowed him with all the earnestness of a learned and contemplative man, while at the same time conveying his authority.Titian, along with Raphael, set the standard for court portraiture during the subsequent development of Western painting.

The blue served as a middle tone, with the shadows and outlines drawn in black chalk and the rippling back muscles highlighted in white. Just as in his characteristically textural paintings, Titian combined the three colors to fully model a three-dimensional figure. The smudgy, roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of the varied play of light over a sculptural form.

Owing to the popularity of the subject, Titian and his workshop made at least seven versions of this painting.X-raysof the painting revealed that Titian made numerous changes to thecomposition, suggesting that he used this canvas to work out his ideas over a considerable period of time. This Getty painting is unique because it is the only composition that shows the Magdalene'sBibleresting on a cloth-covered support rather than a skull--a symbol used to invite contemplation of death.Images of Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman whomJesusfound worthy to redeem and who would spend the rest of her life in solitude to atone for her sins, were especially prevalent during the Counter-Reformation, a period of devout Catholicism that lasted from approximately 1540 to 1640. Upon seeing Titian's conception of Mary Magdalene, the art historian Vasari declared that the picture ""profoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire.""",42 x 36 5/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00053601.jpg,Italian,Oil on canvas,The Penitent Magdalene

Cupid sleeps in the background, a symbol of Adonis's resistance to Venus's entreaties, since his ineffective arrows hang uselessly in a tree. The story ends tragically; during the hunt the mortal Adonis is fatally gored by a wild boar.Titian's loose, energetic strokes of paint give the painting a sense of spontaneity and movement. In some areas, the artist even painted with his finger, as seen in Adonis's arm.

He suggested textures through varying styles of line, from the loose sketchiness of the puffy trees at the left to the more detailed, yet fluidly rendered, drapery on the female figure at the right. Carefully and economically placed hatchings capture the goat's shimmering fur. Titian even created air with line, as in the atmosphere that envelops the distant city.The subject is enigmatic, though it may relate to the erotic mythologies that Titian was painting for King Philip II of Spain at about the same time.

His behavior was unpredictable, and often violent. Desperate, his mother had him committed to a clinic, then known as an asylum, outside of Paris.While in the clinic, Toulouse-Lautrec set upon the idea of creating a series of circus drawings to demonstrate his emotional stability and thus secure his release. Drawn from memories culled over many years of attendance at this popular entertainment, these works reveal his acute observation of horses, dogs, acrobats, clowns, and bareback riders. In this image, a performer still wearing her slippers follows a lumpy horse into the arena to perform for the spectators in the stands.

Aesthetician John Ruskin wrote of this drawing that Turner captured ""the whole surface of the sea . . . undirected, bounding, and crashing, and coiling in an anarchy of enormous power.""To convey the experience of nature's turbulence, Turner used the full range of watercolor technique, from transparentwashesin the sky to thickbodycolorin the water and rocks. He added highlights to enrich the texture and atmosphere, blotting the wash to reveal the white of the paper in the lighthouse and scratching directly into the paper to render the flecks of light in the waves crashing over the boat. With these bold techniques, Turner came close to modern abstraction in his efforts to expand the expressive and stylistic range of landscape painting.He made this watercolor for a series of engravings entitledPicturesque Views in England and Wales, published between 1827 and 1838.",11 1/4 x 17 5/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00025001.jpg,British,Watercolor andbodycolor,"Long Ship's Lighthouse, Land's End"

Turner used quick, slanting brushstrokes to describe the stormy sky. The application of scumbled white paint suggests churning, turbulent seas and the heavy spray of waves hitting the ship's bow. Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the sea's violent power.On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673.

Instead of trying to show depth, however, the countryside simply forms a pattern of almost abstract trees and zigzags.

But as he and his followers approached the gate, stones fell from the walls, blocking his passage. An angel appeared and told him that in his opulent clothes, he could not enter through the same gate that Christ had humbly entered riding on a donkey. The message of this story is clear: the kingdom of heaven is open only to those who have forsaken the riches of the material world.The Exaltation of the Cross, in the form of a narrative series, appeared in several early Renaissance frescoes.

An ornate headdress and, above her right temple, a jeweled pin with a plume of osprey feathers, complete her ensemble. Although formally attired, the young woman shows a slight smile and subtly tilts her head.Jan van de Velde's drawing technique derived from his training as an engraver. He used a variety of fine, hatched lines to describe the soft contours of the face and distinctive texture of the fur. In capturing this likeness on a small sheet of precious vellum, Van de Velde also displays a miniaturist's touch; for example, the osprey plume is composed out of a handful of thin, parallel strokes.",3 7/8 x 3 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/24278001.jpg,Dutch,Pen and brown ink onvellum,Portrait of a Lady

Three men in broad-brimmed hats stand supervising on the left, while other sailors await the goods or attend to other vessels.Using brown ink, Willem van de Velde the Elder outlined the boats and gave definition to ropes and shipping tackle. In contrast, he used a blue-graywashto give volume and depth, using only a few simple strokes to suggest the folds of the sails. Building up the human figures by blending wash and ink, he made quick, sure lines that evoke each gesture and costume without many specific details.

Van Dyck exchanged Titian's sweeping horizontal composition for a more tightly integrated, vertical format, allowing him to give greater prominence to the shrouded Virgin, who holds the arm of her dead son. The gracefully turning form of Saint John the Evangelist at the center links the two figures flanking Christ.Van Dyck demonstrated his virtuosity by using a variety of techniques and media in his characteristically intense, heavily washed, and broadly drawn style. After sketching in black chalk, he drew the figures in pen and ink and went over much of the composition with strokes of dark brown wash. He also drew a rough framing line around the composition.

The luxurious swirl of cloth, its brilliant sheen, and the way it glimmers and reflects light display Anthony van Dyck's virtuosity as a painter. The family coat of arms seen on the drapery behind the sitter at the left, along with other documented portraits, firmly establishes Pallavicini's identity.In 1621 Van Dyck left Antwerp and traveled to Italy, where he stayed for five years, viewing large private collections of Italian paintings and painting various portraits.

85.PB.31,Anthony van Dyck,1630 - 1632,"Near death after being tied to a tree and shot through with arrows, Saint Sebastian barely notices the angel helping to remove them. Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance.Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.",16 x 12 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/00087401.jpg,Flemish,Oil on panel,Saint Sebastian Tended by an Angel

He probably began by drawing the Scheveningen woman on the verso. Possibly dissatisfied with its murky effect, he may also have cut down the sheet to its current dimensions. Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field.With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape. Divergent and well-observed details combine into a single overall scheme, conveying a sense of open outdoor space.

In letters and pictures, Van Gogh idealized Roulin, regarding him as both a man of the people and a sage.Facing frontally, Roulin is pushed close to the picture plane, with his eyes looking slightly wistfully to the side. Van Gogh's energetic lines describe Roulin's full beard, his facial structure, and his somewhat crooked nose. With the dark, thick lines of a reed pen, Van Gogh hatched the vibrating coat and cap.

There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he beganIrises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints.There are no known drawings for this painting; Van Gogh himself considered it a study. His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to theSalon des Indépendantsin September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition: ""[It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life.""Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines.

The artist employed a warm, glowing palette of gold and orange, endowing the figure with a luminous quality appropriate to a holy person.The initial, cut from an antiphonal, probably introduced a generic text devoted to martyrs, which was individualized by the insertion of a particular saint's name. The saint shown is thus not a specific person but a composite martyr accompanied by the attributes of a number of saints who died for the Christian faith.  The wool comb at the figure's feet was an instrument used to torture Saint Blasius, the rocks could refer to the stoning of Saint Stephen, the fire may refer to Saint Lawrence who was roasted alive, and the swords could indicate any number of martyr saints.

Focusing on the combination of sunlit rock, overgrown trees, and undergrowth that formed the entrance to the murky tunnel opening at the back, he concentrated on a factual representation of the scene, including the fine roadside tomb on the left. The small chink of light in the midst of the shadow marks the other end of the tunnel, giving a sense of its length and breadth.Known as theGrottoat Posilipo, this tunnel, cut by the Romans to link Naples with the town of Pozzuoli, was a famous tourist attraction in the 1700s. Visitors admired it both for the drama of its tall, dark, and narrow space and as a feat of Roman engineering.",13 9/16 x 19 1/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/11257301.jpg,French,"Pen and brown ink, with brown and graywash, over black chalk",The Entrance to the Grotto at Posilipo

Then he creates the weather for them, and a sky, a season, a fortune or misfortune, as his fancy strikes him.So wroteDenis Diderotabout Claude-Joseph Vernet in his 1765Salonreview. Vernet's popular views of harbors and ships led to frequent copying and imitation, especially by a group of French artists working in southern Italy who followed his lead in specializing in Mediterranean harbor scenes.In a manner characteristic of Vernet's followers, this painting's peaceful arrangement balances a delicate tree and massive building at the left with an open view on the right. Human architectural constructions frame the intermingled sea and sky.

2002.9.1,Claude-Joseph Vernet,1767,"Claude-Joseph Vernet depicted a storm's aftermath: dark clouds above an angry sea, a shipwrecked boat and its anxious survivors, and listing ships in the distance. As the sea furiously beats against the shoreline, waves explode beyond the rocks in a froth of white. The motion of the waves, the distant rain shaft, the battered ship, and even the bodies of the fleeing castaways fill the scene with strong, opposing diagonal lines. The lighthouse standing solidly upright at the painting's center counters all of this activity.The strong colors of the shipwrecked survivors' clothing stand out against thepaletteof greens, grays, and browns in the turbulent sea. Clearing skies cast the survivors in an eerie glow; dark tones at the left and lower edges and in the waves themselves draw further attention to the bright figures.The scene as a whole suggests the powerful force of nature over man.

Meanwhile, a man sits and smokes his pipe, the tobacco glowing a bright red. A cumulus cloud, perhaps the remnant of a distant storm, towers to the left of the setting sun. Warm tones of yellow, orange and red predominate, suggesting a hazy sunset after a bright day.InA Calm,Vernet portrayed a completely peaceful scene in striking contrast to itspendant,A Storm on a Mediterranean Coast.Taken together, the two works show, on the one hand, nature's benevolence, and on the other, nature's fury.",44 1/2 x 57 3/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/14472201.jpg,French,Oil on canvas,A Calm at a Mediterranean Port

He left out the background, concentrating instead on the arrangement of the seated figures, positioned to illustrate different attitudes of listening and contemplation.Veronese swiftly sketched the figures, outlining only the basic forms and used parallel hatching to suggest areas of shadow, texture, and depth.

Drawing from memory instead of copying exactly all the intricate details of an original, he drew various details on one side only, such as the multiple rows of scrolling on the left shoulder and arm.Although these studies do not match any known figures of men in armor by Paolo Veronese, either as portraits or within larger compositions, scholars suspect that Veronese or an artist close to him worked on this sheet. As in known Veronese drawings, this armor is presented as if it contains a gesturing man rather than as a uninhabited still-life form. The diagonal line of white highlights across the shoulder and stomach also closely correspond to a Veronese portrait of a man in armor. The rather broad, suggestive modeling, with sharper, darker chalk lines for emphasis, resembles other drawings by Veronese.

Such a scene of miraculous intervention was especially attractive to Protestants in Holland, who believed in doctrines of faith, mercy, and divine grace.Jan Victors took his subject from the Book of Tobit, among the Apocrypha in the Old Testament.

The center female was once painted white and wears a type of headdress called apolos, typical of Greek goddesses. These busts, however, are harder to identify than those on the front of the cup. Some scholars identify them as Zeus, Hebe, and Hera, suggesting that the subject of the cup as a whole would be the apotheosis of Herakles, his introduction on Mount Olympus as a god.

Running time: 11:49 minutes,Bill Viola,2002,"In the publicationBill Viola: The Passions,the artist describes the plot of his videoEmergence:Two women are seen sitting on either side of a marble cistern in a small courtyard. They wait patiently in silence, only occasionally acknowledging each other's presence. Time becomes suspended and indeterminate, the purpose and destination of their actions unknown. Their vigil is suddenly interrupted by a premonition. The younger woman abruptly turns and stares at the cistern. She watches in disbelief as a young man's head appears, and then his body rises up, spilling water over the sides and out onto the base and the courtyard floor.The cascading water catches the older woman's attention, and she turns to witness the miraculous event. She stands up, drawn by the young man's rising presence. The younger woman grasps his arm and caresses it as if greeting a lost lover. When the young man's pale body reaches its fullest extension, he totters and falls. The older woman catches him in her arms, and with the help of the younger woman, they struggle to lower him gently to the ground. Lying prone and lifeless, he is covered by a cloth. Cradling his head on her knees, the older woman finally breaks down in tears as the younger woman, overcome with emotion, tenderly embraces his body.As a work of art,Emergencetranscends this--and probablyany--literal description. The video resembles a painting because it is framed, mounted into a wall, silent, and the narrative occurs in extremely slow motion. As a rear-projection installation, it assumes an otherworldly glow. Although the plot suggests biblical stories such as Christ's Resurrection, such metaphorical associations are ambiguous: For example, the man rising out of a fountain of water implies birth, but his body, when laid out on the ground, suggests death.It is the viewer's participation almost as a bystander to a miraculous event, however, that makes the work mesmerizing. During the nearly twelve-minute video, the observer experiences the same extended passage of time as the women waiting by the well. This deliberate slowing down of sensual input encourages a heightened awareness of the characters' every nuanced expression and movement--and in turn, of the viewer's own perceptive process.Emergencewas commissioned by the Getty Museum as part of theBill Viola: The Passionsexhibition organized by the Museum in 2003.

In 1534 in Hall, Austria, Wolfgang Vitl founded one of the earliest northern Europeanglasshousesto produce Venetian-style products, employing both Venetian glassblowers and local craftsmen. To protect his investment, Vitl succeeded in gaining fromEmperor Ferdinand Ithe sole right to produce colorless glass (referred to as ""white"" glass) for fifteen to twenty years. Documents relating to this glasshouse indicate that Vitl aimed to provide quality vessels that would be less expensive for the Austrian and German upper classes than importing Venetian glass.Molds were brought from Murano to northern glasshouses, allowing Vitl and glassblowers elsewhere to produce identical forms. Known as an umbo vase because of the pattern of umbones or bulges around the body, this vase was patterned on those produced in Murano.

The young god's lithe, elongated body and the pronounced shift of his body weight from one leg to the other are characteristic features of theManneriststyle.The figure's downward glance suggests that the original work was meant to be executed on a larger scale and to be seen from below. Alessandro Vittoria probably designed this freestanding figure and a bronzeMinervaaspendants, both of which he signed.The drapery support behind the figure suggests that the bronze is a copy of a work originally carved in marble and then reproduced in metal.

The groups of figures are differentiated by subtle variations, from silhouetting the figures in the boat on the left to illuminating the fishmongers and their customers in the center.By the time he painted this picture, Volaire, who settled in Naples in 1769, had become a one-man assembly line for paintings of MountVesuviusin moonlight.

Elaborately worked and squared so that it could be copied on to a canvas, the drawing served as amodellofor one of Volterrano's most famous paintings, now in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence.

With sensitivity and economy, he added luminous highlights of white lead. To develop the boundaries of her body and define her relationship to other elements, Volterrano relied on more than contour. For instance, he used the paper, touches of lead white, and the chalk shading that defines the cushions to create the form of her left arm.Volterrano made this drawing for a fresco in a palazzo in Florence.

Simon Vouet experimented with the position of her outstretched arm, first drawing it in at a higher level before partially erasing it and starting again.Vouet applied black chalk in long grace strokes, describing the gentle curves of the woman's arms and body with strong outlines and subtle shading. The shading enhances the impression of mass and solidity. Dark shadows that extend backwards from the feet of both figures also contribute to the illusion of weight and mass.In the male nude onverso, Vouet drew a similarly monumental figure seen from slightly below and readjusted the position of the figure's right arm.

Simon Vouet drew him in his cardinal's robes while clasping in his hands a letter, an attribute of his life as an official of the Church and the State. Richelieu's direct, incisive gaze holds the viewer's eyes and attention.King Louis XIII commissioned Vouet to produce a series of some thirty portrait drawings of noblemen, artists, and officers of the court in colored chalks on light brown paper. In this highly finished example, Vouet used a combination of red, black, and white chalk. The red chalk shows off the brilliant color of the cardinal's cape and hat, while the white creates soft highlights in his hair and collar. Black chalk lines behind the cardinal give the figure added weight and depth. Finally, layers of pastel on top of the chalk give the surface of the drawing added richness and texture.",,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/11324101.jpg,French,"Black, white, and red chalk and pastel","Portrait of Armand-Jean du Plessis, Cardinal de Richelieu"

The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.",14 x 2 9/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/01286401.jpg,Greek,Terracotta,Oil Jar with a Woman Carrying a Basket of Offerings

The grid of thirty-six silkscreen-on-canvas panels, each 20 x 16 inches, was one of his first commissioned portraits and the second painted portrait based on the photobooth images.Ethel Scull and her husband Robert became identified with Pop Art through their patronage of and generous hospitality toward the artists of ""the latest thing.""

Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein had painted Mickey Mouse on a challenge from his young son to prove that he could ""draw like the people who did cartoons,"" but this made his friend Andy Warhol jealous. Lichtenstein had ""gotten to Mickey first,"" thus scooping Warhol on representing the popular cultural icon.Lichtenstein and Warhol collected each other's work. As part of a trade between the two artists, Warhol made this Polaroid study in preparation for painting his friend's portrait.

98.XM.168.4,Andy Warhol,1977,"In the late 1970s, Warhol painted portraits of Liza Minnelli based on his Polaroids. Minnelli, a Hollywood child who first appeared onscreen as a toddler, was an important part of Warhol's inner circle in the 1970s and 1980s. She had formidable show-business parents--singer-actress Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli--and achieved her own lead roles in stage productions only after performing with her mother and working as an apprentice on other musicals. In Minnelli Warhol found a powerfully iconic face with strong elements ready-made for the Polaroid. Her short black bangs, large dark eyes outlined with heavy makeup, and full lips painted a dark red stood out in the print even before they were transferred to silkscreen, which would simplify them even further. Warhol finally chose to paint from another print, rather than from this one. Perhaps he felt that the red-orange hooded dress gave the composition a somber, mourning quality unfit for the sitter's home. On the other hand, Warhol must have appreciated the simple lines and religious overtones of Minnelli's draped head and sad gaze. He portrayed her as an alluring celebrity while suggesting her private burdens.",3 3/4 x 2 7/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13385301.jpg,American,Polaroid Polacolor,Liza Minnelli

The bulky apparatus could not easily be moved for compositional changes; it had to remain stationary while the subject was arranged. Then, when all was ready, Polaroid's technician was on hand to operate it. In spite of these restrictions, Warhol seems to have had fun making more than ten portraits--most of them self-portraits.Warhol made four extreme close-up self-portraits with the new camera in a single day, including this one. He seems to have quickly understood that he had to get very close to the enormous camera, to confront it almost, thus making a larger-than-life-size portrait that exploited the camera's unusual potential. He gazed upward and away from the lens, leaving the left side of his face in deep shadow.

He admired ""the boys who spend their lives trying to be complete girls,"" so in 1981 he and a photographic assistant, Christopher Makos, agreed to collaborate on a session portraying Warhol in drag. In many ways, they modeled the series on Man Ray's 1920s work with the French artist Marcel Duchamp, in which the two artists created a female alter ego name Rrose Sélavy for Duchamp.Warhol and Makos made a number of pictures, both black-and-white prints and color Polaroids, of their first attempt. For the second round of pictures, they hired a theater makeup person. This stage professional better understood the challenge of transforming a man's face into that of a woman. After the makeup, Warhol tried on curled, straight, long, short, dark, and blonde wigs.

98.XM.168.5,Andy Warhol,1981,"In Andy Warhol's depiction of his old friend Robert Rauschenberg as the wounded artist, the gauze and bandages add layers to the portrait in a way similar to Rauschenberg's own layered working methods. He and Warhol met in 1960 and two years later got together at Warhol's studio in a session that provided inspiration for both artists. Rauschenberg discovered the silkscreen process that Warhol was already using to transfer photographic images to canvas, and Warhol decided to do a series of paintings based on family snapshots of Rauschenberg, taking him as his first non-celebrity Pop subject. Through large canvases that repeated his portrait as many as twenty-five times, Warhol made Rauschenberg's face famous.A passion for photographs, including those they made themselves, was at the center of artmaking for both Warhol and Rauschenberg.

He's got a great loft on Christie Street. He was a middle-class Brooklyn kid--I mean, he went to college and things--and he was trying to be like that, painting in the Greenwich Village....I took a Polaroid and he went home and within two hours a painting was back, still wet of him and me together. And I mean, just getting to Christie Street must have taken an hour. He told me his assistant painted it.Thus Andy Warhol described his first impressions of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Warhol made this portrait in the fall of 1982, when he was first formally introduced to the newly famous twenty-one-year-old painter. Warhol was one of Basquiat's heroes; the young star, in turn, represented for Warhol the creative sexual energy of the 1960s. The two prolific artists carried on an intense friendship in the mid-eighties, culminating in an artistic collaboration. Basquiat died of a drug overdose before he was twenty-eight, fulfilling his belief that ""the true path to creativity is to burn out.""",3 3/4 x 2 7/8 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13385501.jpg,American,Polaroid Polacolor,Jean-Michel Basquiat

Warhol made his Polaroids of Haring, seen here on the left, and his partner Juan Dubose, in preparation for several forty by forty-inch painted portraits, one executed in black and white.

After he settled at the Chelsea Hotel, where segments of Warhol's film were shot, he began making photographs, often self-portraits or portraits of his roommate, the poet Patti Smith, and usually with a borrowed Polaroid camera.Mapplethorpe's maturing approach to photography resembled Warhol's in many ways. He had no patience for the technical side of the medium and prided himself on gaining a reputation without ever having made a print himself. Portraiture was his main theme, and he used the camera as a means of making connections with celebrities, potential patrons, and possible lovers. In the 1980s, sales of Mapplethorpe's pictures soared. Warhol was commissioned to paint his portrait, so Mapplethorpe sat for the preparatory Polaroids, including this one.

As the oldest of the prince's three children, she had served as ""first lady"" of Monaco since her mother's tragic death in an automobile accident the previous fall. Andy Warhol portrayed her in the same aloof style that had been her mother's hallmark.Warhol considered royalty another element of the Pop scene. His representations of Princess Caroline, however, were more in the tradition of Hollywood studio photographers than that of court painters. Warhol posed Caroline in profile, as if he were photographing a legendary star, with her long, soft, wavy hair hanging loose on her bare neck.

Although he sacrificed the top of the tree, he was able to place the miniaturized Yosemite Falls at the visual center of the picture.

He liked to trace the origins of his intense interest in photographing women to his teen years, when he worked briefly as a walk-on actor at the ballet. Later, he often found that a certain amount of flirtation was involved when taking pictures of women. Winogrand produced a book of his photographs of anonymous women, including this image, in 1975. He planned to title the book ""Confessions of a Male Chauvinist Pig,"" but his publisher changed it toWomen are Beautiful.Despite his joking provocations, Winogrand's intentions were serious.

Composed of two parts, one form twists and curves upward, suggesting the distinct, massive horn of a ram. The second, more compact form evokes the long-faced shape of the skull. Its indentations suggest the hollow space of the eye sockets and mouth. But each part also clearly departs from a naturalistic depiction. In fact, it is not the forms themselves but their varied surfaces--furrowed and grained or smooth and polished--that most acutely conjure up a craggy, decaying skeleton. It is as if we have stumbled upon some slightly unfamiliar archeological find.Jack Zajac's inspiration to sculpt a ram's skull came from casually squeezing balls of wax into shapes he found appealing. According to the artist, he noticed a striking resemblance to an animal's skull in the wax's contours. Zajac then elaborated this form into a more immediately recognizable image. TheRam's Skullseries is comprised of fourteen unique sculptures. Several of the sculptures, like this one, are made up of two discrete parts. The decision to separate the skull and horn arose when a plaster Zajac was working on broke in two and he appreciated the effect of this ""accident.""Zajac builds his plaster models by hand and carves directly into the surface using hand-axes and chisels.

In Federico's will of 1603, he left his palazzo to the Accademia di San Luca so that it could be used as a hostel for poor, young artists coming to study in the capital.

Federico Zuccaro included himself in the scene, aged two or three and clinging behind his mother's skirts. Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author and painter, mentioned this event in hisLives of Painters, Sculptors and Architects, noting that Taddeo ""went off alone, at the age of fourteen, to Rome."" In his own copy of Vasari's book, Federico elaborated on Vasari's account: ""when Taddeo grew older and able to judge things for himself, realizing that there was little more that he could learn from his father . . . and that he was still not experienced enough to be of any help to him, at the age of fourteen he went by himself to Rome.""",10 13/16 x 10 1/4 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13468701.jpg,Italian,"Pen and brown ink, brush with brown wash, over black chalk and touches of red chalk",Taddeo Leaving Home Escorted by Two Guardian Angels

The building that he sketches has now been destroyed, but scholars have identified the palazzo.Giorgio Vasari, the Renaissance author and painter, included this story in hisLives of Painters, Sculptors and Architects, noting that: ""In Rome he had a hard time at first, being friendless and lonely. The one person he did know treated him more unkindly than anyone else, for when he humbly approached Francesco il Sant'Angelo, a journeyman artist employed by Perino del Vaga for grotesque decoration, who was a relation, Francesco, behaving as relations often do, gave him neither practical help nor even advice, but turned him harshly away.""",7 1/16 x 16 5/16 in.,www.getty.edu/art/collections/images/l/13469001.jpg,Italian,"Pen and brown ink, brush with brown wash, over black chalk",Taddeo Rebuffed by Francesco Il Sant'Angelo

It is a cold evening, and she has removed her shoe to warm her foot before the open grate. A cat hovers near the fire too, curled up on the ledge above the woman's head. In order to prevent Taddeo from having bread, his employer the minor painter Calabrese kept it in a basket attached to the ceiling in the center of the room. He attached a bell to the pulley and rope so that it would ring every time the basket was lowered.Taddeo appears again at the front of the room, leaning against a low wall and holding an oil lamp so his master can examine a drawing.

So shaken was his mind, and with the imagination he had, he really believed these to be what they seemed to be. He began his search for the stones that seemed better and more beautiful; he filled a sack, in which he carried his small things and his drawings.""
