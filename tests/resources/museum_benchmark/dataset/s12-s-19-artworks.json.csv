"1587","A diagonal line follows the diminishing figures, from the looming body of the good thief at the extreme left edge, to Christ hanging on the cross in the center, to the bad thief at the right, and finally down toward Jerusalem, lightly sketched in the distance. A tumultuous group of figures and horses crowds around the feet of Jesus at the left, with rearing horses, the Virgin weeping, and Saint John pointing at himself; but the top left of the composition remains open. With such techniques, Hans von Aachen created an effect of dramatic spaciousness.Von Aachen probably made this large and impressive drawing as a preliminary study for a painting. He first sketched the composition extensively in black chalk, which is particularly visible in the torso and hand of the thief in the upper left corner and in the city of Jerusalem in the lower right. Next he laid in the figure groups in graywash, making extensive use of the white paper for highlights; finally, he worked over the entire composition, defining elements with relatively sparing touches of pen and brown ink.","13 1 8 x 18 1 16 in.","Pen and brown ink, graywash, and black chalk underdrawing","German","The Crucifixion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00040301.jpg","Hans von Aachen","92.GA.83"

"1926","Late in his life, Eugne Atget made many photographs in a public park that overlooked the river Seine on the outskirts of Paris. The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal chteau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones. Berenice Abbott, a young American photographer who befriended Atget and purchased many of his prints and negatives after his death, made this print some fifteen years later.","6 7 8 x 8 3 4 in.","Albumen silver print","French","Saint-Cloud","www.getty.edu art collections images l 18990701.jpg","Eugne Atget","2002.37.14"

Union Square has long been a center of commercial activity, as well as a busy intersection where people catch one of the many subway or bus lines that run along Lexington Avenue, Columbus or Broadway. While recording the intersection, Abbot also documented the area's prominent billboards and businesses.Abbott's intention when making this photograph was not simply to record a place, but to convey the vitality of New York. Her work during this period parallels that of Walker Evans, who often photographed New York's hurrying pedestrians, advertisements, and varieties of architecture as evidence of popular culture.","7 3 4 x 9 3 4 in.","Gelatin silverpirnt","American","Union Square, Manhattan","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04401701.jpg","Berenice Abbott","84.XM.222.2"

Certain elements of this new landscape recur in his photographs: uniform, boxy houses, concrete, cars, and dirt plots--as well as a sense of loneliness and isolation.  People had moved to enjoy nature, but found that nature was mostly inaccessible except on weekends,  Adams wrote.  Often little of it was even visible out the window.

"1845","As the first of his twelve Labors, the Greek heroHerakleshad to slay theNemean Lion, a monstrous beast with an impenetrable hide that was ravaging the countryside around the city of Nemea. Since weapons were of no use against the creature, Herakles' only option was to strangle it. Herakles battling the Nemean Lion was the most frequently depicted mythological scene in Greek art. In early depictions, Herakles stands facing the lion, but by the late 500s B.C., the combatants were depicted down on the ground, stretched out in opposite directions.On this Athenianred-figurekalpis, a tree bends over Herakles and the lion, a rare example of landscape elements in Greek art. Throughout theArchaicperiod and into the earlyClassical, vase-painters focused so completely on the figures in theirnarrativescenes that they excluded almost all background elements. Scenes played out in a sort of visual vacuum without any setting at all. On this vase, for example, the tree serves only as a marker to indicate that the action takes place outdoors.The kalpis is the rounded form of ahydria, or water vessel, favored by red-figure artists in this period.

On the front, two nude men dance between two clothed onlookers; on the back, three nude men appear to dance around a fourth clothed man. As was typical in the work of the Affecter, the figures, both dancers and observers, gesticulate strongly, but there is little meaning in their gestures. For all the apparent activity, the figures are quite passive. The Affecter put so little emphasis on thenarrativecontent of his work that scholars often have difficulty determining precisely what is being depicted. For example, some scholars interpret the figures on the back of the vase as dancing, while others see a scene of courtship. Nonetheless, all the figures are beautifully drawn with dramatic silhouettes emphasized by long angular limbs. This vase stands outside the normal stylistic trends for Athens and was probably designed for export to Etruria. TheEtruscansimported large quantities of Greek vases, and certain Athenian artists appear to have focused on this market, adapting their product to Etruscan taste.","10 7 8 to 10 15 16 x 10 1 4 in.","Terracotta","Greek","Water Jar with Herakles Wrestling the Nemean Lion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01408601.jpg","Aegisthus Painter","86.AE.230"

On the back of the vase, Theseus battles the Minotaur. The Affecter depicted the two great heroes of the Greeks, Herakles and Theseus, battling monsters, symbolic victories of Greek civilization over the barbarians, yet he did not appear very interested in the stories. For example, in Greek mythology, Herakles battles two centaurs, Pholos and Nessos.The depiction on this vase is quite unusual for Athenian pottery of the time, because the Affecter did not provide the clues that would identify which encounter was represented here. It is, however, quite typical for the Affecter, who focused primarily on the decorative aspects of figures. His unusual approach to potting is also evident on this vase, where he threw an old-fashioned neck-amphora form but modified it by adding a raised ring to separate the neck from the body. The oddness of the Affecter's style may be explained by the fact that he appears to have been creating vases for export to Etruria. He created products to suit Etruscan rather than Greek taste.","15 1 4 x 9 1 4 in.","Terracotta","Greek","Storage Jar with Dancing Figures","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01378901.jpg","Affecter","86.AE.70"
"530","By the early 400s B.C., professional teachers had established schools in Athens. These teachers, who specialized in various aspects of education, provided training for the male children of parents who could afford to pay the tuition. The most basic education in one of these schools would have involved reading and writing and perhaps arithmetic. At about the same time, scenes of youths at school learning their lessons began to appear on Athenian vases, part of a growing interest on the part of vase-painters in depicting scenes of daily life.This smallred-figurecup fragment shows a boy holding a scroll while another person, perhaps his teacher, stands in front of him. Scholars have disagreed over what the scroll says. Some read it as the beginning of a list of mythological figures. Others see it as a fragment from an epic poem by Hesiod,  The Catalog of Women.  The latter interpretation may be more accurate since all other scrolls in school scenes contain epic poetry. Schoolboys were made to memorize the works of great poets, especiallyHomer, as moral instruction.This school scene comes from the interior of the cup. On the exterior, only the feet of two young men remain.","15 1 4 x 10 1 8 in.","Terracotta","Greek","Black-Figure Neck Amphora","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01379401.jpg","Affecter","86.AE.75"

The jar balanced on the well, the flamingolike camels in the background, and the jewel-laden chest in the foreground are elements of this story. The plaque is based on a mid-seventeenth century image of Rebecca and Eliezer by Jacopo Amigoni, whose paintings and engravings often served as a model for the decoration of plaques and tapestries. It is likely that the painter of the plaque had a print of Amigoni's work in hand but transformed it into the more amorous Jacob and Rachel subject, probably for a specific patron.","2 11 16 in.","Terracotta","Greek","Boy Reading a Scroll","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01423301.jpg","Akestorides Painter","86.AE.324"
"1755","Lying on the ground with one arm outstretched, a beggar pleads for crumbs from a rich man's table while dogs lick his sores. This drawing is the second in a series of five preparatory studies Heinrich Aldegrever made for a set of engravings. The series illustrates the Biblical story of Dives and Lazarus from the Book of Luke. Lazarus, a pauper, lived outside the gates of Dives's afluent home. While Dives lived in luxury, Lazarus lived off the crumbs from his table. When the two died, Lazarus was taken to heaven, while Dives went to hell. Dives was punished for eternity because of his mistreatment of Lazarus on earth.Although the story takes place in the early Christian era, Aldegrever placed the figures in a fashionable interior of the 1500s. Artists often chose to use contemporary settings to make it easier for their viewers to identify with the characters. Dives's feast takes place in a sumptuous interior decorated with bottle glass windows. On the floor, glass vessels fill a wine cooler. Elaborately attired figures seated around the banquet table fail to show the beggar any charity. A servant carrying chafing dishes high above his head emphasizes that Dives's abundant food is unobtainable for Lazarus.","37 x 18 3 4 in.","Faience","Spanish","Plaque Depicting Jacob Choosing Rachel to be His Bride","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13359701.jpg","Alcora Ceramic Factory","99.DE.10"

Her elegant outfit is complemented by an array of jewelry--a long strand of pearls, a necklace set with precious stones, a pendant with a smallreliefof theHoly Family, and pearl drop earrings. The sitter was clearly a woman of status and affluence, and the sculptor depicted her with a powerful and distinctive psychological presence.The fine details of the sitter's costume, jewelry, and hairstyle display a true mastery of marble carving. Maria Cerri's intricate coiffure--amassof curls ornamented with loops of satiny ribbon--falls gracefully around her face. Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round. The attention given to her lace and jewelry makes this as much a portrait of her accessories as of the subject herself.Married in 1637, Maria Cerri and Bartolomeo Capranica were from prominent Roman families. Acoat of armsidentifying both families appears at the base of the sculpture.

"1640","Held up by a triton wearing a garland of seaweed at his waist, Cupid suckles at a woman's breast-probably that of Venus, the goddess born from the sea. Her scallop-shell chariot drawn by two dolphins is a common attribute, recalling her birth from the sea. In the background, Neptune, ruler of the sea, brandishes his trident and rides in a shell chariot drawn by two hippocamps (sea horses).In this drawing, Alessandro Algardi combined idealization of the human body derived from classical sculpture with convincing, realistic representation based on close observation of the human form. His energetic use of chalk imbued the scene with movement and caught the effect of light, particularly in his modeling of Venus's soft skin and the tritons' muscular flesh.Algardi most often made drawings in association with sculptural projects. As the master of the illusionistic pictorial relief during the Baroque era in Rome, he may have designed this arrangement of figures for a low-relief sculpture, possibly for execution in embossed metalwork. Either Algardi, an assistant, or a later artist pricked only the outlines of the main group for transfer to another surface. Only the main group may have been used, or the project may have been abandoned or altered on the right side.","35 7 16 x 24 1 8 x 11 1 2 in.","Marble","Italian","Bust of Maria Cerri Capranica","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13876301.jpg","Alessandro Algardi","2000.72"
"1645 - 1650","Two contemporary Bolognese draftsmen worked at different times on this unique drawing. Sculptor Alessandro Algardi added the figures after painter Francesco Grimaldi had created the landscape. By inserting the Holy Family, which fits so naturally into the composition, the elder Algardi may have meant to improve his junior colleague's composition. The figural group balances the central tree and gives the landscape a recognizable subject matter. To achieve greaterluster, Algardi also may have added the brownwashthroughout.The artists' styles are distinctive. Algardi drew his playful family grouping with a more delicate, graceful, even fragile line than Grimaldi's bold squiggles and hatching, which are especially evident in the dynamic, dominant tree.These two artists often worked together on architectural commissions, yet only one other similar sheet exists, an architectural drawing in which Algardi corrected and added to Grimaldi's work.

Characteristically, Alessandro Allori added playful touches: slender, graceful nymphs, possibly Proserpine's former companions, pick flowers and frolic while being observed by satyrs. The abrupt truncation of Pluto's chariot and horses at the bottom of the panel and the bright, saturated colors display frequent characteristics of FlorentineMannerism. Allori's complicated, twisted poses and his cool, smooth style reflect the influence of his adopted father and master Bronzino.Allori painted this panel, along with many others, as decoration for the Villa Salviati, a private home near Florence.","14 3 8 x 10 3 8 in.","Pen and brown ink with brownwash","Italian","Landscape with the Holy Family (Rest on the Flight into Egypt)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00045301.jpg","Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi","94.GA.78"

In this way, he suggested the festival's great antiquity through architectural details, dress, sculpture, and even the musical instruments based on Roman originals.Alma Tadema's curiosity about the ancient world was insatiable, and the knowledge he acquired was incorporated into over three hundred paintings of ancient archeological and architectural design. He said:Now if you want to know what those Greeks and Romans looked like, whom you make your masters in language and thought, come to me. For I can show not only what I think but what I know.Alma Tadema's paintings also enjoyed popularity later, when his large panoramic depictions of Greek and Roman life caught the attention of Hollywood.

Christ falls beneath the weight of the cross in the center of the scene, while a Roman soldier goads him on with the end of his pike and an elderly, bearded Simon tries to assist him.Albrecht Altdorfer conveyed the scene's drama by packing a monumental, relief-like concentration of figures into a tight space. The crowd presses forward onto the four central figures, wrapping around them and creating a claustrophobic effect. The bold vertical lines of the cross and the soldier's pike lead the viewer's eyes diagonally down to the main image of the kneeling Christ. Altdorfer displayed exceptionally varied line work, particularly in the figure of Christ. There he used strokes of gray wash to emphasize and soften the black ink outline, while in other areas he created shadows with the wash.Probably part of a series representing the Passion, this is Altdorfer's only surviving design for a stained-glass window.","8 x 10 7 8 in.","Pen and brown ink, brown and blue-graywash","Flemish","Forest Landscape with a Distant Castle","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00015801.jpg","Denys van Alsloot","86.GA.9"

In this composition, what once may have been the entrance to a large building looms large in the foreground. The corroded structure evokes the architectural ruins of Mexico's formerly great civilizations--ballcourts, temples, and palatial compounds that served as settings for dramatic rituals.

Until the Spaniards' arrival, the horse was unknown in Mexico, and it remained alien to that culture for many years. When the Aztec people saw a horse for the first time, they mistook the formidable animal and its rider for one single being. Alluding perhaps to this historical encouter, Alvarez Bravo's image merges the bodies of horse and man, as the larger horse obscures the workingman's head.","9 9 16 x 6 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Mexican","Burro Grazing","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10516501.jpg","Manuel Alvarez Bravo","92.XM.23.8"

The tattered piece of cloth hanging from a twig-like branch--referred to as a  little flag  by Alvarez Bravo--serves as a scarecrow in a recently planted field.

For Strand, Alvarez Bravo had mastered the medium of photography and used it  to speak with warmth about Mexico. Like many of Alvarez Bravo's photographs, this image illustrates the day-to-day struggle--and resourcefulness--of Mexico's poor. The ramshackle setting is the residence and workplace of a scrap collector, who has assembled a collection of artifacts in the hopes of attracting a potential buyer. Alvarez Bravo's title,Fable of the Dog and the Cloud, draws attention to the only two elements in the image that are capable of movement, implying that the collector's stagnant goods will remain unsold.","6 13 16 x 9 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","Mexican","Little Flags of the Land","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10520001.jpg","Manuel Alvarez Bravo","92.XM.23.43"
"1930 - 1940","Photographed at close range, a stack of books is transformed into a geometric study of shape and mass, light and shadow. Manuel Alvarez Bravo selected works from his own library for this composition, which suggests a towering form of modern architecture. At the bottom of the stack is Maurice Raynal's 1922 monograph on Picasso, a foundational text that greatly influenced Alvarez Bravo. Picasso's work encouraged the artist to experiment with abstract and cubist compositions. The viewer can only speculate about the contents of the books stacked on top of the monograph, but it is likely that these volumes were equally important to Alvarez Bravo's development as a photographer.This formal, abstract image indicates that, by 1930, Alvarez Bravo had absorbed many contemporary modernist ideas, even though he lived in Mexico City, far from the main centers of avant-garde artistic production. Because of his location, Alvarez Bravo depended largely on printed words and images as sources of inspiration.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser","6 9 16 x 8 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Mexican","Fable of the Dog and the Cloud","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10520101.jpg","Manuel Alvarez Bravo","92.XM.23.44"

The photograph's title,Parabola optica, compounds this wordplay.Parabolaboth suggests the shape of something and alludes to parable, a story with multiple meanings.

Perhaps Alvarez Bravo was trying to guess the girl's thoughts, as she stood immersed in her reverie, clearly unaware of his presence and indeed vulnerable to his camera.

"1940s","Part of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's career involved photographing murals, the visual evidence of Mexico's culture that was freely available for public viewing. In this image, he captured a different kind of scene--a view opened to the gaze of any passerby and newly made possible by the invention of the X-Ray machine. This assortment of X-Ray images illustrating the internal skeletal structure of the human body was mounted outside the laboratory storefront of a colonial building in downtown Mexico City. Linking radiography to photographic methods, this searching exploration of surface and anatomy, of the visible and the concealed, became a hallmark of Alvarez Bravo's work.Gift of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser","9 3 16 x 7 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","Mexican","Entrance to the Anecdotes","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10520201.jpg","Manuel Alvarez Bravo","92.XM.23.45"

Carefully mincing her steps, the young woman carries a parcel; in Manuel Alvarez Bravo's eyes, she is making an offering. The young man, on the other hand, hurries along, propelled forward by his lengthy gait. Alvarez Bravo saw the man's movement as flight, as if he were hiding or running away. Above them, a different kind of movement stirs the clothelines, as laundry items saturated with midday sun blow in the breeze. Though their paths are about to cross, the lives of these two people may never connect.

Like many of Manuel Alvarez Bravo's photographs, this image explores the devotional aspect of Mexico's daily life.Since the 1500s pilgrims have been visiting Chalma, where a miracle is believed to have taken place. Christian missionaries, eager to convert the indigenous people, persuaded them to renounce their worship of Otzocteotl, a deity to whom they offered prayers and sacrifices. The miracle occurred when the venerated statue was found shattered and in its place rose a crucified figure. Though nearly five hundred years have passed, Christians still make pilgrimages to the site. In illustrating how the pilgrims mark their route, Alvarez Bravo's photograph reveals the rustic accoutrements of a cultural tradition.","7 3 16 x 9 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","Mexican","Pilgrim of The Things of This Life","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10520501.jpg","Manuel Alvarez Bravo","92.XM.23.48"

Her shawl's tassels swing in the air and, from afar, appears to brush the seated woman's arm.Alvarez Bravo sometimes referred to this image asSueo de una turista,meaningTourist's Dream. The tourist here is Doris Heydn, his second wife, whose socks and huraches emphasize her foreign origins. Heydn had accompanied Alvarez Bravo on a photography expedition to the countryside.

Alvarez Bravo, who came of age during the violent Revolution of 1910-1920, often saw dead bodies burning in the street.The Mexican people may have viewed the kiln--a site of fiery transmutations--as an allusion to the Spaniards' conquest and purging of the Aztecs in the 1500s. About this image, one historian has said:   The photograph does not project sorrow or excessive drama, but quiet and noble resignation.

A rare and difficult technique, coral-red glaze is known from only about sixty surviving vases.

This drawing is far larger than the engraving, and Amman eliminated thebackgroundlandscape to monumentalize the figure of the officer. The artist created texture and depth with only two techniques: fine vertical hatching and thick black outlines.

On therecto, with strong, sure strokes, he worked out the musculature of the kneeling apostle who appears in the painting's left foreground. On theverso, the standing nude figure with drapery provides the pose for Saint Thomas. Of the two heads later crossed out by the artist, the one at the upper right resembles the apostle on the recto. Del Sarto used these poses again in other paintings.Del Sarto's working process of making a series of preparatory drawings for each of his paintings became a model for other artists of the 1500s. He began by quickly jotting down a first idea, then, as in the kneeling figure on the recto, he made studies of individual figures, checking them against a live model. He also used sculpture as a source. Del Sarto then developed the initial composition into a sequence of studies drawn in rapid, soft strokes of black or red chalk, which led to the final version for the painting. The finalcartoonwas transferred to the wall or panel.","11 x 6 in.","Pen and black ink; the surface of the paper rubbed with black chalk","Swiss","An Officer of the Rank of  Oberster Feldprofoss  in the Imperial Army","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00027601.jpg","Jost Amman","89.GA.15"

Solely to develop the figure's overall pose, he made the nude study for Moses on theverso, which is much more simply drawn. While del Sarto continued the Florentine HighRenaissancetradition of the large, classic form and measured pose, he also began to deviate slightly from their ideals. The nude figure on the verso may no longer quite represent ideal proportions; he is more stocky, perhaps more like a peasant, when compared to the consistently noble nature of figures by Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael.","5 5 8 x 3 13 16 in.","Red chalk, black chalk sketch of face (recto); red chalk (verso); sheet torn horizontally and repaired","Italian","Study of a Kneeling Figure with a Sketch of a Face (recto); Figure Study and Face (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00006101.jpg","Andrea del Sarto","84.GB.7"

He overlaid numerous ideas for each figure, quickly trying one thought, then modifying it for the next. Beyond giving the figures balance, he aimed to make them look natural and relaxed. With the railing both standing in front of and bisecting the figures, the artist also had to work out how to maintain unity between the upper and lower halves of each figure.

The outdoor fantasy setting of her grotto project incorporated both ancient works and contemporary pieces made specifically for the project.Because of his reputation for reviving ancient forms--the source of his nickname--Antico's sculptural work was perfectly suited to Isabella's project.

As the defenders lean out from the battlements, menacing with their spears, the attackers raise their shields in response, and the warrior on the right reaches back to hurl a stone. Apollodoros did not identify this battle, but it may be a scene from the mythological Seven against Thebes or theTrojan War. Although vase-painters in the closing years of the 500s B.C. began to show an interest in the setting of their scenes, the depiction of battle in an architectural setting is very rare in Greek art. This use of an architectural backdrop meant that Apollodoros had to alter his vase-painting technique from the standard red-figure. The figures set against the wall had to be drawn in outline.Today the cup is reassembled from fragments, but it was already broken and repaired inantiquity.

In the 1400s, the image of the nude male and the use of bronze were revived as Italian artists looked back to the culture of ancient Greece and Rome for inspiration. Though its subject is ancient, this work was conceived in a thoroughly innovative style of expressionistic and dramatic movement. In typicalManneriststyle, the figure twists elegantly, revealing a play of shimmering effects on the surface as the light reflects off pronounced muscles.

An advertisement for absinthe, a liquor flavored with wormwood and fennel, appears adjacent to the guards on the right side of the photograph. Soon after this picture was taken, the beverage was outlawed in France because a chemical in one of its ingredients caused convulsions, hallucinations, mental deterioration, and psychoses.

Eugne Atget composed the photograph so that the viewer's eye is led down a path toward Marie de' Medici's seventeenth-century Palais de Luxembourg. Although the path is not occupied on this wintry day, the presence of a few gentlemen--one overlooking the River Seine, another seated on a park bench--suggest that Parisians frequently traveled along it.During the 1600s the rich decoration of the Palais de Luxembourg had a powerful influence on French taste, especially on interior decoration. One of many former royal residences of historical significance in Paris, it saw other uses after the monarchy fell. It served as a prison during the French Revolution, and the senate assembled there during the reign of Napoleon.","8 5 8 x 7 in.","Albumen print","French","Fountains at Juvisy","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06999701.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.37"
"1902","This study of a shop window in Paris unites interior with exterior in an intriguing juxtaposition of reflections and objects. The sidewalk, which is completely overexposed in the foreground, is revealed in detail in the reflection of the shop window. A clear depiction of the photographer at work is also evident: Eugne Atget appears in profile, standing at his camera in the lower-center pane of the shop window, as though he is a miniature automaton prominently placed for sale. It is almost impossible, in fact, to tell where the reflection of the street ends and the contents of the shop begin. A lamppost appears to be up for sale alongside a mantel clock; a wagon wheel is displayed just under a cherub to the right of the vases. The overlapping of the contents of the antique store with the everyday objects of the rapidly urbanizing city suggests that Atget was making a commentary about the reduction of Old Paris into nothing more than a collection of curios.","8 11 16 x 7 in.","Albumen print","French","The Temple of Love, Petit Trianon, Versailles","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06999801.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.38"
"1902 - 1903","Eugne Atget's photograph of a pavilion and column documents an architecturally and historically significant site. The pavilions were constructed in 1787; six years later, in 1794, more than one thousand people were guillotined here in a two-month period during the French Revolution. Atget was well versed in the history of Paris and was concerned with recording important sites as well as aspects of the culture that were disappearing. The pavilion and the column comprise an ensemble that was part of a gateway in the wall that circled Paris.","8 3 4 x 7 1 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Luxembourg Gardens","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07001401.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.54"
"1902","Eugne Atget's particular interest in places with historical associations led him to the magnificent chteau of Fontainebleau, where a tourist guide stands at the foot of its famous horseshoe-shaped staircase. Atget's steep perspective resulted in an imposing composition in which the chteau forebodingly looms over the expansive courtyard. The guide's presence enlivens what otherwise would have been an image of frigid majesty.Once a royal palace, Fontainebleau had housed generations of sovereigns beginning as early as the 1100s. The complex and irregular building that currently exists, which includes a court theater commissioned by Napoleon III in the same year as Atget's birth, is the result of numerous additions and alterations by Fontainebleau's many residents.","8 9 16 x 6 15 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Antique Store, 21 Faubourg St.-Honor","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07073301.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.120"

Other eclectic elements, such as the decorativefriezeof Roman figures above the sphinxes and the vaguely Moorish archedtrefoilwindows on this building, also crept into urban architecture in Paris at this time.Eugne Atget revealed his interest in historic architecture in a letter describing the inventory of negatives that he hoped to sell to thecole des Beaux-Arts:  I have amassed . . . artistic documents of fine civil architecture  from the 1500s through the 1800s,  old hotels, historic or curious houses, . . . fine facades.  Inevitably, Atget also recorded bystanders in his urban photographs; they became fundamental elements of the final images. When taking this picture, Atget and his cumbersome tripod-mountedview cameraclearly drew the attention of four men in front of the street-level restaurant.","8 5 8 x 6 7 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Ancienne Barrire du Trne","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07012701.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.168"
"1903","Drawn to the masses of dark foliage and the abstract quality of the staircase, Eugne Atget photographed this spot on the left bank of the Seine River repeatedly, beginning in 1904. During the 1600s, orange groves flanked either side of these stairs, which were once part of a royal estate. After the chteau that had occupied these grounds burned in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, the gardens were all that survived.The absence of children or other pedestrians leisurely enjoying the park imparts a sense of solitude and loneliness to the image. Atget intended that his photographs be used as source material for artists of all mediums. This empty park would have provided a simple background, like a stage set, for an artist to copy and then enliven with the addition of figures.","8 7 16 x 6 15 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Courtyard, Fountainebleau","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07122901.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.121"
"1903","Fallen leaves littering the steps undercut the glory of this monumental sculpture symbolically representing the triumph of France over Spain and Austria. The sculpture, on the grounds of Versailles, was clearly meant to exalt Louis XIV, who wrote,  In my heart I prefer fame above all else, even life itself . . . . Love of glory has the same subtleties as the most tender passions.  He and his ministers often sponsored such works, using allegorical figures and symbols to convey narrative meaning. The trophies of armor signify military skill, and the fleurs-de-lis adorning the shield and garments of the figure in the ceremonial chariot were an emblem long associated with the French crown.","8 5 8 x 7 1 16 in.","Albumen print","French","House on the Place du Caire","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07125101.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.127.3"
"1904","Numerous staircases were necessary to connect the various sections of the gardens on the sloping terrain of Saint-Cloud, a royal summer retreat on the River Seine. This one linked the terrace of the chteau to that of a horseshoe-shaped basin. Although decorative vases remained at the top of the flight of stairs when Eugne Atget made this photograph, the sculptures that once stood on the blocks of stone halfway up the flight had disappeared. His diagonal perspective resulted in a composition of abstract repeated forms, where curving stairs appear as the receding lines of a harmonious and rhythmic study.From the 1700s on, many artists painted the gardens of Saint-Cloud, most often as a landscape or, in some examples, as the background for picnics, parties, and puppet shows. Atget made this image as part of his collection of  documents for artists,  which were meant to be used as source material by all types of artists.","8 11 16 x 6 15 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Staircase, Saint-Cloud","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07000001.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.40"
"1904","This statue of a grinning Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, looms over a corner of the park at Versailles, squeezing grapes into a bowl as if beseeching visitors to celebrate and make merry. The weathered facade of the statue, however, contrasts with Bacchus's role as a god who should be attended and worshipped; like the overturned chair and the scattered dead leaves, it emphasizes the abandonment of the park. Although a place of great festivities, the empty park appeared desolate and neglected when Eugne Atget photographed it.","8 11 16 x 6 7 8 in.","Albumen print","French","France Triumphant, Versailles","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07001901.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.59"
"1904","This photograph of two arches that were part of an arcade running along one side of the garden of the Palais Royal in Paris is unusual in Eugne Atget's work because of the symmetry and straightforward angle used to define the composition. An illustration of elegant yet colossal design, this image recalls architectural renderings more than photographs. It is one of many Atget made in his  documents for artists  collection, which were meant to be used as preliminary sketches.  Architects would have purchased this photograph for the information it conveyed about the proportions and details of this building from the 1700s.","8 7 8 x 7 in.","Albumen print","French","Terrace Stairs, Saint-Cloud","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07002101.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.61"
"1904","To a casual observer, Eugne Atget may have seemed like a commercial photographer, making a living documenting architecture for artists, designers, and institutions. Perhaps he had the Bibliothque Historique in mind as a client for a series of photographs he made of Parisian interiors belonging to people of various social classes. This room was undoubtedly the most luxurious of all, located in an ornate building then serving as the Austrian Embassy.In this relatively close-up view, Atget focused on a fireplace with an elaborate clock and candelabras on its mantel, and two floral-patterned chairs on either side. The fireplace is filled with a large mirror that reflects a slipcovered couch, and on it, Atget's hat and overcoat. The photographer's tripod-mounted camera is nearby with a black focusing cloth draped over it. These items suggest the image as a kind of self-portrait, although Atget probably did not intend it as such.Atget was so personally interested in the history of Paris that he spent years documenting the city. As this photograph attests, Atget's work encompassed and transcended both documentation and the seemingly opposing self-expression.","6 15 16 x 8 15 16 in.","Albumen print","French","A Corner of the Park at Versailles","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07002401.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.64"

Baskets and a few rags hang out of the uppermost window, while two people below observe Eugne Atget making this picture. On a windowsill to the right, houseplants bask in the sunlight invading the tall shaftway. Although people inevitably ambled in and out of this courtyard, dropping off and picking up their ironing at  the most pleasant ironers,  the absence of activity when this picture was created conveys a stark sense of gloominess. The weather-beaten facades  and the rubbish bins at the left further underscore this impression. During the time that it took to record the details of this space on Atget's glass plate negative, the brightness of the sunlight from the street outside caused overexposure of the view through the portal.","6 3 4 x 9 in.","Albumen print","French","Royal Palace","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07008801.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.128"

Two cauliflower heads at the center of the top shelf surmount the presentation in the same fashion as a floral centerpiece. Merchandise display of all sorts was a persistent theme in the work of Eugne Atget, whose street-level perspective allowed viewers to feel as if they were the passersby encountering the merchandise themselves.","9 1 8 x 6 3 4 in.","Albumensilver print","French","The Austrian Embassy, 57 Rue de Varenne","www.getty.edu art collections images l 18988101.jpg","Eugne Atget","2002.37.1"

When he reprinted from his original negative, Atget moved significantly closer to the sign itself, which allowed him to capture the details of the ironwork at a larger scale.Historic architectural embellishment, such as this ironwork, was a significant part of Atget's work. He marketed his series of prints, entitled  documents for artists,  to a modest clientele of artists who would have used the images as source material for their own work.","8 11 16 x 7 3 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Old Courtyard, rue Quincampoix","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04028001.jpg","Eugne Atget","86.XM.628"

This vendor used stacks of books, rather than struts, to hold the stand's lids aloft. When she was ready to close up, the dealer would fold the lids down and the fronts upward.The famous Bastille prison that stood nearby once housed prohibited books, which were considered as dangerous as its other occupants, persons charged with crimes against the Crown.

For this photographer concerned with places and aspects of Parisian life that were disappearing, this alley, essentially unaltered from a much earlier period, was an ideal subject for his photographic collection.

To make the shop's services and wares more alluring, the mannequins wear elaborate cosmetics and filmy, delicate fabrics.Beginning in the mid-1800s, when haute couture first appeared, Paris dictated the chic mode in women's styles. Fashion plates and journals throughout Europe and America illustrated French garments and accessories. Although Atget specifically avoided photographing subjects associated with fashion and individual display, this composition reveals his fascination for how shopkeepers exhibited their wares.","9 x 6 7 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Metalworker's Shop, passage de la Runion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07009301.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.64.133"

The fence along the right side and behind the dwelling shows that property in this village was clearly demarcated and more secure than many of the city's slums. Atget's extensive documentation of Parisians excluded the wealthy in favor of the poor, for whom he was genuinely concerned.","8 3 4 x 7 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Tinsmith's Shop, rue de la Reynie","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06222901.jpg","Eugne Atget","84.XM.1034.5"

Apparently, Atget felt that the subject was of historical interest and should therefore be documented.

To create the effect of great distance, progressively smaller greenery recedes along the alley behind the pool.

The absence of people and activity has transformed the garden into a place of isolation.The gardens at Versailles were of great importance to Louis XIV, who oversaw their design and visited them daily when he was at the retreat south of Paris.

To Atget, it was important not to record popular destinations and fashionable districts but to create  artistic documents . . . of old hotels  and  historic or curious houses.

"1922 - 1923","The curbs of the sidewalk and the sharply angled lines of the dark buildings looming on either side of this image guide the eye along a path through a Paris intersection. Eugne Atget repeatedly photographed this neighborhood, usually during the early morning, when pedestrians were scarce and the streets were tidy. The arrangement of strong horizontal and vertical lines, with the street sharply receding into the distance, resembles a stage set immediately after the curtain rises.","8 11 16 x 7 3 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Roses","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06222401.jpg","Eugne Atget","84.XP.208.7"
"1922","In this meditative image, boats moored near the Pont Neuf, the oldest existing bridge across the River Seine, rest on still water. By the time Eugne Atget created this photograph, he had previously documented the embankments and quays along this section of the river and their attendant commerce. While the earlier images possess a clearly documentary purpose, this image reflects Atget's interest in mood, here effected by the palpable damp rising from the water.The shift from prosaic to poetic studies in Atget's work reflected a change in his sensibility after World War I. Although the mood in these two styles of photography differs, both would have been appropriate for Atget to market to his artist-clients for use as source material.","9 1 4 x 6 13 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Cour de Rohan","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06223201.jpg","Eugne Atget","84.XM.1034.8"
"1922","The carousel is in the exact center of the image; an equal amount of sky and ground surrounds it. Like many of the figures who were captured in Eugne Atget's photographs, the bow-tied bunny at the right appears to be eyeing the photographer cautiously and curiously as Atget goes about recording him. The pleasure spectacle of the carnival ride is made ordinary by the ladder visible at the right toward the back of the ride. Carnivals were usually traveling shows, stopping for only a short while before moving on to the next town, and this attraction was probably still being assembled when Atget came upon it and set his tripod down.The two small, half-oval marks along the top of the print come from the clips that held the glass negative plate in place in the back of the camera. They appear in many of Atget's prints and serve as a kind of trademark, even though they may look like a mistake.","8 15 16 x 7 1 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Rue Cardinale","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07125001.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.127.2"
"1923","The bare trees and high, weather-stained wall in front of this building convey a contemplative atmosphere that seems especially appropriate for an old convent. Propped against the wall behind the gas lamp, a ladder suggests a romantic scene from literature, perhaps an escape of some sort.

"1923","The three amiable women posing in the doorway of a dilapidated building convey an image of friendship and leisure. Their mid-length dresses and covered legs belie the fact that they are prostitutes. Although Eugne Atget was commissioned to photograph prostitutes in 1921 by a customer writing a book on the subject, scholars have not explained his return to the subject in 1924.Berenice Abbott, who diligently worked to purchase many of Atget's negatives and prints after his death in 1927, printed this image about twenty-five years after Atget made the photograph. Abbott once remarked that  the photographs heralded as art in France in the early part of the century were the worst arty pictorials that existed anywhere.  Especially offensive to Abbott was the way photographers presented their female subjects as inane pictures of the  pretty.  In Atget's work, everyone from small shopkeepers to tradesmen and prostitutes was treated with dignity, an approach that Abbott defined as the  shock of realism.

"1923","Eugne Atget made a number of prints from the negative of this spiky angular building; this example was exposed for longer than the others during the printing process, yielding a darker composition. As a result, the picture gives the dramatic impression that it was made during that indistinct period of early morning when the sun is rising and night is fading away. Other prints of this image are lighter and, consequently, less striking. To accommodate the tall structure within the parameters of his lens, Atget was forced to position his camera at a considerable distance from the building, filling the foreground with an expansive fork in the road.","8 7 8 x 7 1 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Old Convent, avenue de l'Observatoire","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07124901.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.127.1"
"1924 - 1925, print about 1950","Historians have suggested that the solitary tree served as a kind of self-portrait in Eugne Atget's photographs. Trees were a favorite subject of the reclusive and private photographer, and they appear often as silent witnesses in his views of Paris and its environs. In a busy architecture study such as this one, the lone, winter-bare tree dominates the composition, its branches drawn carefully on the blank slate of sky. The old neighborhood's bleak textures of mildew, decaying wood and plaster, and scarred stone fill three-quarters of the frame, while the few signs of nature, such as the tree and the modest garden of the house at the left, hold forth a promise of seasonal renewal.","9 1 16 x 6 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Three Prostitutes, rue Asselin","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06992001.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.46.1"

In the foreground, the facade of the 1625 manor appears to crumble; in the background, the effects of urban industrialization have blackened the formerly pristine church of Saint-Eustache. The short focal point of Eugne Atget's lens compressed the architecture so that the grimy elements of the two buildings are difficult to separate. Cutting across the foreground at a dynamic angle is the rue du Jour, enlivened by the shadowy presence of a woman adjacent to the tilted barrow.","6 13 16 x 8 7 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Staircase, Montmartre","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07123301.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.124.1"

They appear aloof, indifferent both to Eugne Atget, who photographs them, and to the mysterious voyeur whose legs, reflected in the glass, are visible just above the  250  sign. The reflection of the blowing trees in the glass may suggest an imminent storm directly above the mannequins' heads, hopelessly blurring the line between inside and outside. The domed building in the reflection is the former chapel of the Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory, which became the Gobelins Museum. Its looming presence frames the mannequins as if they were on a stage.","7 1 16 x 8 7 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Htel Scipion Sardini, rue Sardini","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04021801.jpg","Eugne Atget","86.XM.23"

Barely visible within the open tent, a sideshow still life of empty chairs and shoes beckons. Eugne Atget photographed the entrance to this street fair from at least three angles, including this one and a close-up of the display just within the tent.Between the circular vignetting caused by the shifting of Atget's short-focus lens and the string of lights hanging over the top of the artificially grand faade, the tent appears like a two-dimensional set rather than any kind of space that could be entered. The photograph is a study of textures and the visual trickery associated with the street-fair trade. Like a good sideshow attraction, it seduces with its grandiose columns, marble surfaces, and larger-than-life painted illustrations, but what lies within may or may not measure up to such promises. Upon closer inspection, the  marble  base is held together with two strips of tape in the lower right corner, and a rough stick wedged into a corner of the tent opening indicates a less-than-solid structure.","7 x 9 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Htel de Royaumont, rue du Jour","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06223401.jpg","Eugne Atget","84.XM.1034.10"

Placed in front of each chair and facing each other as if in confrontation are high-topped shoes scaled to the would-be occupants of the seats. Signs with  1  entrance fees and photographs of two men of dramatically unequal size hang suspended around the chairs, seeming to float in space. A lone light bulb hovers above the entire scene, punctuating the blackness with its distinctive silhouette.What is this surreal sideshow still life of presence and absence  Taken just inside the sideshow tent, the photograph is a close-up view of a street-fair display advertising the attraction of Armand the Giant and the smallest man in the world. As Eugne Atget has isolated the arrangement, it is a curiously haunting advertisement that is more disturbing than inviting. He also photographed the fair booth in a sidelong view that shows the tent's fake exterior.","7 1 16 x 8 15 16 in.","Geletin silver print (sepia toned)","French","Storefront, avenue des Gobelins","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06223901.jpg","Eugne Atget","84.XM.1034.15"

Although the fairgoers and sideshow attendants had dispersed by the time Atget made this photograph, litter on the pavement attests to their earlier presence.Atget intended his photographs to be used as source material for artists, such as the noteworthy painter Maurice Utrillo, who modeled a 1927 painting on this image.","8 7 8 x 7 1 16 in.","Gelatin silver","French","Street Fair (Fte du Trne)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06992501.jpg","Eugne Atget","90.XM.46.6"

Atget may have chosen to photograph this building to illustrate the sharp contrast between its flat, comparatively windowless planes and the colonnaded buildings that surround it.Although this structure is new, the Place Pigalle had been a center of bawdy nightlife since at least the 1870s, when artists and writers frequented its bohemian cafes and music halls. Despite the Place Pigalle's colorful history, Atget seems not to have photographed here until 1925, when he made this picture.

The distance from the window also allows for a bit of mystery concerning the creatures or parts being preserved within the jars.

"1926","Late in his life, Eugne Atget made many photographs in a public park that overlooked the river Seine on the outskirts of Paris. The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal chteau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones. Berenice Abbott, a young American photographer who befriended Atget and purchased many of his prints and negatives after his death, made this print some fifteen years later.","18 1 2 x 14 11 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","The Marne at La Varenne","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06224301.jpg","Eugne Atget","88.XM.20.2"

Anne Dixon originally gave the album to her nephew, who was interested in photographically illustrated volumes.Dixon and Anna Atkins created each image, or photogenic drawing, by carefully placing the specimen onto a sheet of paper that had been made light-sensitive by a coating of a combination of chemicals. The resulting print is called a cyanotype because of the blue color produced by the chemicals. Securing the specimens to the paper with a sheet of glass, the glass and paper were then placed in the sun; after sufficient exposure to light, the paper was washed in water, which caused the image to appear in its final form.

Influenced by the relaxed approach to portraiture that took hold in Holland around the beginning of the 1600s, Bailly gave the girl expressive eyes, the hint of a smile, and stray locks of hair coming loose from her formal lace headdress.With drawings like this one, Bailly continued the tradition of miniature portrait drawings and engravings that Hendrick Goltzius and Jacques de Gheyn II had established at the end of the 1500s.

The oversized nude conveys mass and weight, but it is in fact a slender sheet of hammered copper supported by an iron armature. The substantial presence of the form is also undermined by the marked absence of head and neck, arms and feet. Finally, the textured, irregular copper surface, an indelible record of the artist's hammering, also animates the figure's sensual curving form.Saul Baizerman executed a pair of large female nudes entitled Night and Day. Night alludes to the work of Michelangelo--in particular, a marble figure of Night from the tomb of Giuliano de' Medici in Florence created in the early 1500s.","H:  7 3 4 in. x W:  9 9 16 in. x D:  5 1 8 in.","Wood painted withvernis Martin;papier mch; printed paper; bronze","French","Celestial Globe","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00679501.jpg","Jean-Antoine Nollet","86.DH.705.2"
"17, 1774","For years, the most distinguished Florentine noblemen, scholars, and artists assembled at the Marchese Valori's country villa outside Florence every summer. There Filippo Baldinucci displayed his considerable amateur artistic talents.  [A]lmost every day he was condemned to make a portrait from life of one of his gentlemen companions, in black and red chalk, choosing by lots each day the one to be portrayed,  wrote his son.Baldinucci drew his friends' portraits, all in roughly the same format, and gave them to his renowned host, who hung them in his villa. After Valori's death, the collection remained intact, becoming part of the Uffizi Gallery's collection in 1866. Baldinucci also made duplicates for his own collection. These duplicate drawings, unbound from the book in which he collected them, were dispersed at London sales in the 1760s. Scholars are uncertain about the identity of this sitter. Theversodisplays an accidental offset from another portrait drawing, most likely by Baldinucci, which suggests that this drawing probably came from his book of duplicates. The residue of a tinted edge along the right side of the paper and traces of stitch holes at the left also demonstrate that the sheet was once part of a sketchbook or album.","12 15 16 x 8 5 8 in.","Crayon manner engraving","British","Korean Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00038001.jpg","William Baillie","91.GE.62"

A plump man in a hat seems attentive but unperturbed, while a standing bearded man has removed his hat out of respect.Hans Baldung Grien arranged the tight composition between two columns, framed by intertwining branches above. A gifted pupil of Albrecht Drer, Baldung Grien had an idiosyncratic style of drawing. He combined long, thin strokes describing the outlines of figures with smaller, sometimes looped strokes for modeling and shading. The stubby hands of the preacher, with their almost circular nails, are also an identifiable feature of his draftsmanship.This drawing's round format and composition suggest to scholars that it was designed as a preparatory study for a stained-glass window.","10 1 16 x 14 1 8 in.","Pen and light and dark brown ink; framing line in dark brown ink; pupils incised by the artist","Dutch","Portrait of a Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00021501.jpg","David Bailly","87.GA.40"
"1964","As he practiced drawing different heads for use in later paintings and prints, Hans Baldung Grien created a pattern unified by abstract hatching. The facing heads represent three distinct facial types: a young woman with long flowing hair and a crown, a bearded man in the top left, and a young man looking upward at the bottom right.By contrast, the six faces clustered in groups of two and four near the upper center of the sheet resemble physiognomic studies, or variations on distinctive profiles. Baldung Grien recorded various hooked, straight, and curving noses combined with rounded, pointed, and sloping or non-existent chins. The artist used light, flowing strokes to outline most of the faces and dark, broader accents to emphasize the eyes, noses, and mouths.","3 1 4 x 3 3 4 in.","Copper","American","Night","www.getty.edu art collections images l 26552001.jpg","Saul Baizerman","2005.103"

The bridge represents the industrial progress ofSecond EmpireFrance: one arch spans the entire length of the photographic frame, dwarfing the simple, rough-hewn barge moored in its shadow, which symbolizes the French past. The rubble at the bottom left suggests not ancient ruins but an active, modern construction site just out of the frame. The official-looking characters assembled atop the bridge contrast with the workers and observers on the riverbank. The image heralds progress, much like the railroad whose tracks are barely visible on the far bank; both represent a dramatic improvement in technology for France.In July 1861 Baldus was commissioned to produce an album of views of the structures and environments along the railroad from Lyon to the Mediterranean.

The railroad, traveling at three times the speed of a horse and carriage, was a unifying element in France, literally and figuratively bridging the country's various regions and promoting an unprecedented sense of nationhood.Like other photographers working in the 1800s, douard Baldus used long exposure times to make his photographs. If an individual or a carriage moved away from its initial position, a faint impression was captured on the negative and appeared in the print. The impression's transparency gives it its name, a ghost image. While Baldus made this exposure, the horse and carriage repeatedly moved, twice stopping long enough to be faintly recorded on the negative.","9 13 16 x 6 15 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and black chalk","German","A Monk Preaching","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00001901.jpg","Hans Baldung Grien","12 1 8 x 8 13 16 in."

The back of the vase shows a battle scene in which a hoplite, or heavily armed infantryman, falls to the ground between two cavalrymen.Herakles being escorted to Olympos in a chariot was an especially popular subject in Athenian art in the late 500s B.C. Some scholars have suggested that the image's popularity was politically motivated: the tyrants of Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, had adopted Herakles as their symbol. An account of Peisistratos's return from exile, in fact, describes how he had a woman dressed as Athena ride in the chariot with him. This vase was broken and extensively repaired inantiquity. One handle was reattached with staples, and the mouth of the amphora was replaced with one taken from another similar amphora. The substitute mouth appears to be at least twenty years later than the original, indicating that the vase had been used for some time before it was damaged.","20 x 30 in.","Albumen print","French","Station at Toulon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14419601.jpg","douard-Denis Baldus","84.XO.734.1.69"

"1864, print 1865","Federico Barocci made this oil study, the first of two, for analtarpiecein the Church of Santa Croce in Senigallia, Italy. Before beginning this sketch, he oiled the paper, perhaps to eliminate the  halo  the paint's oil would have created as it seeped into the dry paper. Here Barocci studied tonal values for the painting, building a largely monochrome composition from rich, dark browns with brilliant bluish-white highlights in the figures' robes, especially that of the figure on the left who supports Christ's legs. He left the kneeling figure of Saint Mary Magdalene unfinished in the right foreground, though she appears in a similar pose and position in the later, more colorful oil sketch and the finished painting.Barocci commonly used an elaborate preparatory method for planning his pictures. After determining the form of a composition, he made several chalk studies for each figure, including separate studies of the limbs and head. He then drew one or more fully worked-up sketches of the composition, such as this one, and finally moved onto the full-sized cartoon.","13 3 8 x 24 7 8 in.","Albumen silver print","American","Clothing Warehouse Chattanooga","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06647101.jpg","Barnard, George N.","9 7 8 x 12 15 16 in."

He placed the boy's head diagonally on the page, and gave it a sense of forward motion by heavily applying light-colored chalks on the face. These light tones appear to advance to the front, and that movement is heightened by the recession into space created by the blue paper. Throughout his career, Barocci made many such studies of heads drawn from life in colored chalks.Barocci made this tender drawing as a study for the head of the infant Ascanius, son of Aeneas, in his only secular narrative painting,Aeneas's Flight from Troy.

White chalk lines create texture on his robe as it slips from his shoulders, while softly smudged patches on his shoulders, neck, and face give his body a glistening sheen.Barocci produced the drawing as a study for a servant in the left corner of a painting. On the verso, another sketch shows the same figure drawn facing the opposite direction.

The four Japaneselacquerpanels date from the mid- to late 1600s and were created with a technique known askijimaki-e.For this type of lacquer, artisans sanded plain wood to heighten its strong grain and used it as thebackgroundof each panel. They then added the scenic elements of landscape, plants, and animals in raised lacquer. Although this technique was common in Japan, such large panels were rarely incorporated into French eighteenth-century furniture.HeavyIonicpilasters, whose copper-filled flutes give an added rich color and contrast to the gilt-bronzemounts, flank the panels.

"1745 - 1749","This image is an early example of a scientific fundamental of photography--the light sensitive nature of certain chemical compounds. Without the use of a camera or lens, Hippolyte Bayard carefully arranged a delicate selection of laces and flora on a sheet of paper that was made sensitive to light with a combination of iron salts that produced a blue-tonedcyanotypewhen developed. The sheet of sensitized paper with the objects placed upon it is exposed to sunlight in order to make a camera-lessphotogenic drawing.The opacity of the object blocks the light in relation to its density, thus creating a silhouette of the object on the paper. Because the process was relatively uncomplicated, cyanotypes provided a quick method of recording easily recognizable shapes and patterns. Bayard filled the entire sheet of paper, creating a catalog of specimens that reveals the basic structure of each flower, leaf, feather, and scrap of fabric.","10 x 12 1 8 in.","Oakveneeredwithsatin rouge;gilt bronze mounts; modern leather top","French","Writing Table (bureau plat)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00614401.jpg","Joseph Baumhauer","71.DA.95"

This photographic view of daily life in the 1840s was quite unusual, demonstrating Hippolyte Bayard's early interest in what later came to be considered a social-documentary approach.Aside from his human subject, Bayard seemed drawn to the negative shapes of the broken glass pane of a shuttered window and those of the barred one below. These graphical forms support the photograph's gridlikecomposition, which seems curiously at odds with its gentle framing. The oval mask may have been an attempt to soften the subject's starkness, following a fine-art approach adopted by photographers in the 1800s.Bayard made many views of Paris in the early years following photography's invention, favoring the British-inventedcalotypeprocess over France'sdaguerreotypeprocess. He created this photograph several years before working on a series of architectural studies for the Commission des Monuments Historiques'Mission Hliographique,a French government-sponsored project to record historic buildings around the city. It also predates Eugne Atget's atmospheric, Parisian street scenes made some fifty years later.","9 3 8 x 11 5 8 in.","Oakveneeredwith panels of Japanese lacquer and painted with Frenchvernis Martin;gilt-bronze mounts;campan mlang vertmarble top","French","Commode","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00603501.jpg","Joseph Baumhauer","55.DA.2"

"16, 1853","Military paraphernalia strewn about the Pehtang Fort in China reveals that a battle occurred shortly before Felice Beato made this image. For over a decade, China and Britain had been engaged in conflict over Britain's right to import opium into China from India. Chinese officials had made numerous unsuccessful attempts to curtail the import of the highly addictive narcotic. When a Chinese ambassador took a drastic measure in 1839--seizing and destroying over 20,000 chests of British opium--Britain immediately attacked.In 1858 Beato accompanied a British expeditionary force sent to punish the Chinese once again for their resistance and rebelliousness. With the aid of French forces, Britain took possession of the Pehtang Fort on August 2, 1860. By October of that year, the second Opium War, as it came to be known, was over, and Britain was victorious. Beato's image illustrates that the soldiers had been in China long enough to adopt some of their styles and customs--in particular, the water carrier in the center of the image.","10 x 12 in.","Hand-coloreddaguerreotype","British","Mrs. R.

The tapestry's foreground shows a field of pineapples and other plants, including a palm and a tall banana tree.The first pineapple grown in France had been given to the King of France, Louis XIV, but the fruit was still rare in the early 1700s and its form was probably unknown to the Beauvais artists who wove the tapestry. They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.","8 ft. 2 1 4 in. x 12 ft. 3 3 8 in.","Hand-colored albumen silver print","British","Kango Bearers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30764601.jpg","Felice Beato","2007.26.201.5"

This fantastic architecture with its spindly Gothic ornament may have inspired designers of the late 1700s and early 1800s who copied the mixture of Gothic and Far Eastern motifs.

Weavers could easily adapt the composition and change the dimensions to fit a specific location without losing the meaning of the design.

The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.","11 1 4 x 16 1 4 in.","Albumen silver print","British","Kachin Women","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30773201.jpg","Felice Beato","2007.26.203.49"

"1968 - 1972","Barthel Beham studied the human skull from three different views: side, underside, and front. The care with which he described the intricate pits, crevices, and ridges, particularly on the underside of the middle skull, suggests that he drew them from life. His keen interest in anatomy was a typical manifestation of the emphasis that theRenaissanceplaced on the study of the human form.Beham also varied the level of finish on each skull. He chose to simply outline the right skull with black ink and to use a more complex technique of hatching and cross-hatching to create the shadows and hollows of the base on the center one. The left skull, with its iridescent brow glowing with white bodycolorheightening, a bold outline, and the use of gray wash to cast shadows and create depth, emphasizes Beham's graphic expressiveness. The drawing appears to have been a preparatory sketch for a print.On the other side of the sheet, Beham freely sketched an architectural study showing the top portion of a facade. Scholars are uncertain whether this was simply a fantasy building or a structure to be used for a specific festival.","9 3 8 x 7 1 16 in.","Gelatin silver prints","German","Water Towers, France and Germany","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31261301.jpg","Bernd and Hilla Becher","84.XM.125.61-69"
"1970","Hans Sebald Beham chose an unusual pose for his standard bearer. Artists typically portrayed such figures in motion, striding forward with a flag fully unfurled, but Beham chose a static, frontal composition instead. The standard bearer strikes a classical contrapposto pose to balance the visual and actual weight of the massive flag, drawn with delicate penmanship.The standard bearer wears an elegant doublet with wide, flowing sleeves that have been quite literally  torn to ribbons.  The fashion for slashing garments became extremely popular in Europe in the early 1500s, particularly in Germany, where it reached the most extravagant levels. Tailors cut slits in the clothing and pulled the lining through to show off its different color. In the same lavish style, the man wears tights held up with ribbons tied below the knee and a broad hat covered with multiple long plumes. Throughout the drawing, the nineteen-year-old artist used distinctive strokes such as the short, hooked lines on the man's thighs and gnarled collarbone. In the dark folds of the flag, Beham explored shadowy areas through varied patches of dark hatching.","9 3 8 x 7 1 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Germany","Water Tower, Neunkirchen, Germany","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04055001.jpg","Bernd and Hilla Becher","84.XM.125.63"

The position of legs and arms, the tilt of the head that echoes the line of his extended foot, the doubled lines that emphasize the movement of the leg, and the curved surface of the jar and the cheeses on the ground display Beham's skill in depicting figures and three-dimensional objects. Beham produced numerous drawings and prints that included peasants going about their daily activities. This picture of a young peasant boy and its pendant showing a peasant woman carrying a jug were probably once on the same sheet of paper.

The drawing's simplified linear style appropriately renders their air of homespun piety. Sebald Beham relied upon simple, bold outlines and hatching to describe the scene, since few details would be visible once the scene was set high in a church window.During the 1520s, Beham and his workshop produced many designs for stained-glass windows. This highly finished sketch was part of a series of more than twenty-five works made for a group of windows showing scenes from the lives of the Virgin and Christ. The drawing functioned as a cartoon for a specialist stained-glass maker, who then cut and painted the glass in shapes and colors according to the design. The color notations and red chalk lines inscribed throughout the drawing indicate the placement of glass sections and leading. The lead was then soldered and cemented around the glass pieces before the panels were secured to the window's iron cross-bars.","9 7 16 x 7 1 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Framework House, Slated Gable Side, Hauptstrasse 3, Birken, Germany","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04059401.jpg","Bernd and Hilla Becher","84.XM.125.107"

"1972","The Savonnerie workshops, the royal manufactory that provided carpets, screens, and covers for chairs and benches for the sole use of the French royal household, made this pair of three-panel screens of knotted woolen pile. Such screens were known asparavents(against the wind) and were usually kept folded in the corners of dining rooms or anterooms of the palaces. When needed, servants would arrange the screens to protect the occupants from drafts.The Savonnerie manufactory produced eight different designs for screens, of which the Getty Museum's examples are the tallest. Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay provided thecartoonsfor these screens in 1714, and Franois Desportes drew the birds in the central panels. Each panel has a yellow ground, while the flowers, leaves, and birds are woven in equally vivid shades.

"1968","The esteemed Flemish artist Simon Bening lavishly illuminated this prayer book for the powerful Cardinal Albrecht of Brandenburg, Elector and Archbishop of Mainz and an ambitious patron of the arts. Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion. The sequence of forty-one brilliantly colored, full-page miniatures that Bening produced for the manuscript was designed to evoke an intense empathic response as the viewer contemplated Jesus' suffering.","W:  10 ft. 2 in. x L:  13 ft. 10 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Water Tower,  Concordia  Mine, Oberhausen, Germany","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04055501.jpg","Bernd and Hilla Becher","84.XM.125.68"

In contrast, Jesus, his physical beauty underscoring his divinity, calmly accepts his destiny. The artist heightened the drama of the confrontation by setting the scene in a darkened, monumental interior,illuminatedonly by eerie torchlight.

Bening thus divided theilluminationinto two halves, using body language and setting to increase the viewer's compassion for Joseph's cause.","6 5 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Albumen print","American","Perched Rock, Rocker Creek, Arizona","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10991801.jpg","William H.

The document lists in detail not only the names of most of the artisans who worked on the cabinet, but also the cost of each part--an unusual and fascinating detail. From this document, researchers learned that the most expensive part of this piece was the elaborately chased and gilded mounts, which show symbols of the king.At some point in the early 1800s, someone replaced the lacquer panels withpietre dure(hardstone) plaques.

This drawing does not feature any typical Italianmotifs, like columns or ruins, but the sun-drenched scene suggests an idyllic Mediterranean setting. In the century after Berchem's death, collectors across Europe sought out these pastoral views.

A multitude of hounds rest in the shadows; and the prize of the hunt, a deer, lies in the right foreground. Two huntsmen converse with a hostess-- perhaps regaling her with tales from the day's chase. On the balcony above, a washerwoman sets out laundry. At left, partly shrouded in shade, a woman serves two seated men. Above this trio, two pairs of tiny figures explore the upper reaches of the towering ruin behind the inn.Nicolaes Berchem is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. In these panoramic paintings, figures generally play a secondary role. By contrast, inThe Return From the Hunt, Berchem focused on the interaction between figures and architectural setting rather than the landscape. The unusual vertical format showcases the artist's command of light. Light falling on the mounted horseman also illuminates the woman on the balcony as well as the figures on the left.Hunters at rest was a popular subject among northern genre painters in the 1600s. In this painting, the pose of the man in blue, seen from the rear, quotes a well-known ancient sculpture of Hercules.

In the background, at right, the faraway towers of the Hague are visible. In the middle ground, wealthy citizens take sleigh rides, and line up to buy hot drinks from a vendor. In contrast with this, and the assorted frolicking dogs and children, the foreground features peasants hard at work cutting wood. Artist Jan Berents also creates atmospheric perspective with the considered placement of trees, flag poles, and church towers. At the base of the image, Berents adds his signature, and a reference to his unusual dual career as a mathematician.This work is part of a long tradition of Dutch genre scenes. In particular, Berents' detailed landscape evokes those by an earlier Netherlandish artist, Pieter Bruegel. Much like Bruegel's figures, Berents' skaters have a somewhat comical air about them due to the extra long blades on their ice skates. Furthermore, his use of vellum, or fine-grained animal skin, his stippled technique, and the detailed portrayal of the winter season all evoke the work of the renowned Flemish miniature painter, Simon Bening.","6 5 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Border with Athaliah Ordering the Massacre of the King's Children","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11043601.jpg","Simon Bening","MS.

"1525 - 1530","When he was less than twenty years old, Gian Lorenzo Bernini carved this marble boy with a dragon for the palace of Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII. Even at this young age, Bernini was such a skilled marble sculptor that he could differentiate the textures of pudgy flesh, soft hair, waves of water, and dragon scales. A hole in the dragon's mouth shows that the sculpture was used as a fountain.The infant Hercules, who demonstrated his divine strength even as an infant by slaying poisonous serpents, appears here as a mischievous boy who smiles, sits on the dragon, and breaks its jaw with his bare hands. Common in Hellenistic statuary, the theme of Hercules and the serpent was revived in sculpture of the early 1600s. Bernini probably based the composition of his work on an antique work, but contemporary concerns also played a role. He may have represented the serpent as a dragon because his patron, Barberini, wished to convey a satirical message about another important Roman patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, whose family coat of arms included a dragon.","6 5 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Border with Christ in the Wilderness","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11043901.jpg","Simon Bening","MS.

His unruly hair and beard and the billowing drapery that winds around his muscled figure evoke the sense of a whipping wind over the ocean. The flattened planes with which the sculptor modeled the muscles on the chest, arms, and legs heighten the feel of strength in the figure's movements. His intense focus on an unseen object before him adds a menacing tone. This drama of physicality and motion is characteristic of the Baroque style.The tabletop bronze is a reduced variant of a marble fountain sculpture made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini around 1620 for the garden of the great collector and patron, Cardinal Montalto, in Rome. All of the four known versions in bronze include a long-bodied dolphin between Neptune's legs, replacing the figure of a triton who served as a supportive strut on the marble statue. Reductions in bronze are unusual in Roman sculpture of the time; the multiple reproductions of Neptune are probably due to the celebrity of its maker, who dominated Roman sculptural production in the seventeenth century.","6 5 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Border with Elijah Raising the Son of the Widow of Sareptha","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11044001.jpg","Simon Bening","MS.

Quick, curving lines and rough shading fill the drawing with vibrant movement: the dolphin in particular seethes with energy. Gian Lorenzo Bernini swiftly outlined the shapes of the rock formations as well as the marine god and dolphin. Using some blunt tool, perhaps even a thumb or finger, he softly smudged the lines to create the shadows that form the contorted pose of the god's muscular torso. Between 1652 and 1653, Bernini sent studies for fountains to Duke Francesco I d'Este for his palace. Other craftsmen transferred this particular design into a terracotta model, and then local, less accomplished workers produced a more static stucco fountain for the central niche of the palace.","6 5 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Border with the Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11044201.jpg","Simon Bening","MS.

A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio. This sketch was meant to inform those polished yet imaginary landscapes, making them more convincing to the eye.","6 5 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Border with Abraham Washing the Feet of the Three Angels","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11044301.jpg","Simon Bening","MS.

"1525 - 1530","In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him.

Silvery morning light dances across the undulating planes, rendered in soft blues, greens, and browns, and highlighted with autumnal yellows. The extraordinary freshness and precision that characterizes this painting conveys the immediacy of nature's impression on Bidauld, and explains why, upon hearing his name, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot was moved to exclaim:  Bidauld!

The uneven, fibrous, opaque color of the ground under Eve distinguishes this area as printed, while the even sweep of the red washes shows that the flames behind Satan are mostly watercolor, a medium William Blake often used because he liked its transparent quality.Blake's images reflected his own very personal visions, which he insisted were  not a cloudy vapour or a nothing; they are organized and minutely articulated beyond all that the mortal and perishing nature can produce.  The twelve large, color-printed drawings that he created in 1795 rank among his most complex works. To achieve the effects he envisioned, poet-painter Blake invented an innovative three-step process: 1) drawing the image with thick, sticky watercolors on a piece of stiff paper board; 2) stamping the sticky image on paper; and 3) working over the resulting print in watercolor washes and pen and ink.

Carefully applied areas of blue wash indicate shadows but also trail off into an atmospheric suggestion of continuity with the surrounding terrain.One of Bloemaert's contemporaries noted that  he has a clever way of drawing with a pen, and by adding small amounts of watercolor, he produced unusual effects.

As he wandered the streets of New York City, he came upon the right type of light to test out his ideas: a dark background behind a brightly lit public walkway where he could anonymously record passersby.

Young and old, fashionable and not, Parisians gather here for an afternoon's leisure. Two young street performers entertain the crowd: one shows an elegant couple his tame marmot, while the other puts on a puppet show for children hardly younger than himself.A resident of the Marais neighborhood, in which the scene takes place, Boilly included a self-portrait, in spectacles and a top hat, at the painting's rightmost edge.","7 11 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Temperacolors and gold paint onparchment","German","Villagers on Their Way to Church","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00187601.jpg","Simon Bening","MS. 50, RECTO"
"1888","Louis-Lopold Boilly's depiction of three artists in a studio conveys the serious and dignified role that he ascribed to the profession. Boilly's harmonious use of black-and-white chalk on beige paper further underscores the subject's sobriety. The three fashionably dressed men, with their tousled hair and intense expressions, confront the viewer with a sense of their fierce commitment to their metier and to each other. In Boilly's numerous variations on this theme, artists are shown in their studios, engaged in discussion with fellow-artists and surrounded by the fruits of their labors. It is likely that Boilly's three sons, all of whom became artists, were the models for this sheet.","10 1 4 x 39 in.","Temperacolors and gold paint onparchment","Dutch","Gathering Twigs","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00187701.jpg","Simon Bening","MS. 50, VERSO"
"1798 - 1799","The identities of the allegorical figures in this marble relief are suggested by the worlds they inhabit--a swirling mix of clouds, flames, waves, and earth. Together they represent the four elements paying tribute to Friendship. To the left, Friendship, who wears a wreath of myrtle, stands on a pedestal with her arm wrapped around an elm tree stump. Cybele, who personifies Earth, leans over two kneeling lions. Triton and Nereid emerge from the sea, representing Water. Zephyr, the Wind, reaches toward Jupiter--who, in the form of an eagle, holds a bolt of lighting that symbolizes Fire.In this sculpture, Louis-Simon Boizot varied the depth of carving to simulate space and physical presence. The foreground--the lions and Cybele, Nereid with her offering of sea treasures--pops forward. The sky with Zephyr and Jupiter, the drapery behind Friendship, and even the lions' rear ends, appear to recede into the background. Considering that the depth of this relief is less than three inches, the illusion of dimensionality is remarkable. The frame carved as part of the sculpture, and the fact that the figures don't protrude beyond it, however, evokes two-dimensional media such as painting.","7 1 2 x 7 5 16 in.","Oak veneered with ebony and lacquer; set withpietre dureplaques; solid ebony legs; gilt bronze mounts;bleu turquinmarble top","Dutch","Cabinet","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00652701.jpg","Guillaume Benneman","78.DA.361"

"1624","This illuminated initial depicts the death of Saint Dominic Guzman, who was the founder of the Dominican Order, one of the most influential monastic groups of the later Middle Ages. The scene was partly inspired by the accounts of a vision experienced by a Dominican friar named Fra Guala de Brecia (1180-1244). In the vision, Fra Guala saw Dominic ascending into heaven on a ladder held by Christ and the Virgin Mary. Beneath this scene, clergy and friars perform funeral rites over the saint's body. Nearby, the poor and infirm gather, hoping to benefit from the saint's relics. These figures did not feature in Fra Guala's vision, nor are they mentioned in textual accounts of Dominic's death. Instead, their presence reflects the medieval tradition of crowds gathering near a saint's relics in the hopes of being miraculously healed by his or her remains. Significantly, this leaf was made in Bologna where Saint Dominic's relics are kept.","9 5 16 x 13 5 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Italian","The Return from the Hunt","www.getty.edu art collections images l 27781001.jpg","Nicolaes Berchem","2006.36"

"1614 - 1620","Somberly dressed in jacket and cravat, Franois Bonvin depicts himself with a serious and intense expression matched by the composition's dark tonality. Bonvin's grainy, dense application of black dramatically contrasts with the bare white paper which illuminates much of his face. This spotlight effect focuses our attention on Bonvin's self-assured gaze and his unsparing self-introspection in black chalk.When Bonvin drew this self-portrait he was about thirty years old. His artistic career was gaining momentum after his first successful exhibition in 1844. Like many Realist artists, Bonvin looked to Dutch artists of the 1600s, whose works could be viewed at the Louvre, for his models. Rembrandt was especially important to Bonvin and this drawing recalls Rembrandt's many dramatic, probing self-portraits. Around this time, Bonvin and Gustave Courbet had struck up a friendship and Bonvin was undoubtedly influenced by Courbet's commitment to realism in art, his black chalk drawings, and memorable self-portraits.","9 7 8 x 6 3 4 in.","Oil on canvas","Italian","Still Life with Dead Birds","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00064901.jpg","Christoffel van den Berghe","71.PA.34"
"1623","Franois Bonvin used delicate modulations of light and shadow to impart a meditative mood to this drawing of the interior of Aramont Abbey. The dynamic angles of the wooden pews and of the rear wall on the left of the drawing lead the viewer's eye to a light-filled side chapel. Along the right side of the drawing, repetitive vertical lines emphasize the interior's elevation. While the church's wooden pews fill the foreground, an organ accentuates the rear wall. The lack of any human presence seems to underscore that this space is meant for personal reflection.Bonvin used many materials to heighten the drawing's sense of perspective and mood. Pen, brown ink, and black chalk outline the church's details. Watercolor fills in the rear wall, the ceiling in the background, and the pews. White gouache highlights the columns and arches in the foreground. In many ways, this finely detailed drawing recalls the work of Pieter Saenredam, Bonvin's predecessor in painting church interiors.","6 1 4 x 16 7 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Tree as Forest, Spring without Leaves, Camera Movement","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06402401.jpg","Ella Bergmann-Michel","85.XP.260.76"
"1630","Focusing on a bare tree, Lon Bonvin drew its web of branches in extreme detail. Beginning with the wiry bush at the left, moving on to the tree, then taking in a plowman and finally a distant town, he subtly leads the viewer through space. He suggested a setting sun through the golden glow backlighting the tree and the scene's pervasive stillness. Bonvin's careful structuring of this landscape, which alternates between wide panorama and minuscule detail, lends the image the complexity and completeness of an oil painting. The exquisite detail and vulnerable, melancholy mood characterize much of his work.As always, Bonvin made this watercolor as an independent work without a commission. By the 1860s, he made watercolors exclusively. His imaginitive mixing of pen and ink with watercolor combines precision with a delicate tonality that recalls early photography.","4 1 8 x 19 5 16 in.","Marble","French","Boy with a Dragon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00135801.jpg","Gian Lorenzo Bernini","87.SA.42"
"1652-1653","Jean-Antoine Nollet designed and assembled this pair of globes, which show maps of the earth's surface and skies. Globes frequently adorned the libraries of the aristocracy, lending an air of scholarly respectability in an age when uncharted territories around the world were being mapped and new trade routes established. They frequently appeared in eighteenth-century portraits but were usually supported on simple turned columns. These examples, with their red and yellowlacqueredstands decorated with Chinese figures, are exceptionally elaborate and may have been made to match similarly lacquered furniture.A pair of globes on tripod stands similar to those in the Getty Museum's collection is reproduced in an engraving from 1740 of the library of a wealthy eighteenth-centuryfinancier, Joseph Bonnier de La Mosson. The second floor of his townhouse was devoted to a series of seven rooms, including a chemistry room with fountains and ovens; an apothecary; alatheroom; a room for his drug supplies; a room that housed his collection of minerals and rare animals, stuffed or in jars; and a room filled with machines and models relating to clockmaking, navigation, and hydraulics.","6 5 16 x 4 5 16 in.","Bronze","French","Neptune and Dolphin","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00147001.jpg","Gian Lorenzo Bernini","94.SB.45"

The duchesse was Nollet's most importantpatronand aunt to the comte de Clermont, to whom the celestial globe is dedicated.Louis Borde, the engraver of the map, also sponsored the costly printing process.

In most depictions of this myth, a favorite among Greek artists in the 600s and early 500s B.C., Bellerophon rides Pegasos, his winged horse, but here he has dismounted, still holding the reins. While Pegasos strikes at the Chimaera with his hooves, Bellerophon spears the monster from underneath.The unique, symmetrical arrangement of the rearing horse and monster framing the hero is the result of the artist's attempt to find creative ways to fill the circular area of the interior of a cup. Three ornamental bands and palmettes at the handles decorate the cup's exterior.Lakonian vase-painters specialized in the decoration of cups; this example, with its high foot and slanting rim, fits the typical form. Both the interest in narrative and the use of the black-figure technique were new to Lakonian vase-painting when this vase was produced.","28 7 8 x 35 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","French","View in the Ile-de-France","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30859601.jpg","Jean-Victor Bertin","2008.2"

Various types of flowers that would not bloom in the same season appear together here: roses, forget-me-nots, lilies-of-the-valley, a cyclamen, a violet, a hyacinth, and tulips. Rendering meticulous detail, Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder conveyed the silky texture of the petals, the prickliness of the rose thorns, and the fragility of opening buds. Insects crawl, alight, or perch on the bouquet. Each is carefully described and observed, from the dragonfly's transparent wings to the butterfly's minutely painted antennae. Although a vague reference, insects, short-lived like flowers, are a reminder of the brevity of life and the transience of its beauty.A rising interest in botany and a passion for flowers led to an increase in painted floral still lifes at the end of the 1500s in both the Netherlands and Germany. Bosschaert was the first great Dutch specialist in fruit and flower painting and the head of a family of artists. He established a tradition that influenced an entire generation of fruit and flower painters in the Netherlands.","11 3 4 x 14 3 8 in.","Silk and wool","French","Tapestry: Toilette of Psyche","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00604601.jpg","Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory","63.DD.2"

The gathers of fabric on which he leans, the wrinkled folds of his coat, and the outstretched length of his legs all create interest and draw the viewer's eyes around the figure and into the composition.Franois Boucher used a technique known asaux trois crayons, in red, black, and white chalks, which he and his contemporaries made popular in France in the 1700s. As a middle tone, he adopted the blue paper favored by Venetian artists.A favorite painter at the French court, Boucher designed tapestries for the royal factories, Beauvais and Gobelins.

"1660 - 1670","In the mid-1700s, the French kingLouis XVcommissioned the renowned Beauvais manufactory to create a series of tapestries illustrating scenes from the story of Psyche. The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.","7 x 6 in.","Gilt silver","American","Pair of Stags","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00132601.jpg","Johan Ludwig Biller the Elder","85.SE.442"

One triton blows on his shell-trumpet while the other, wedged between his partner and a fantastical dolphin, empties water out of his horn. In both sea and sky, putti pay tribute to the goddess. Amid all this attention, Venus remains impassive, decidedly detached from the churning sea.Franois Boucher's immense popularity in eighteenth-century Europe was matched by his versatility; he created everything from cabinet paintings to tapestry and stage designs. But this drawing is one of only three known gouaches by Boucher. In this work, the painter loosely applied the media--his handling varying from the expressive, almost chaotic, energy of the sea to the delicate, linear touch applied to Venus and her female attendants. Given its large size and ambitious composition, the gouache was probably created as an independent work of art and not as a study for a painting. Boucher frequently depicted this goddess, and the gouache bears a striking resemblance to hisVenus on the Waves, a later oil painting also in the Getty's collection.","3 ft. 7 in. x 1 ft. 5 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 1 2 in.","Red chalk heightened with whitegouacheon tan paper","Greek","Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00015601.jpg","Bartolomeo Biscaino","86.GB.6"

Suitors woo and babies frolic in an idyllic setting of lush, green, leafy trees under a pale blue sky with gray-pink clouds.By blending sensuality, covert eroticism, and refinement, pastoral paintings such as these brought the world of aristocratic society and amorous games to the countryside.

Working simultaneously on such tapestries, a number of weavers would take a year to complete three square yards (two and a half square meters) a year. A tapestry of this size would take over three years to complete.","11 1 4 x 15 in.","Albumen print","French","Boston After the Great Fire","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10538201.jpg","James Wallace Black","92.XM.45"

For the ancient Romans, a woman who was raped was guilty of adultery, a crime punishable by death, even though she had not given herself willingly. After she was raped, Lucretia made her husband and father swear an oath of vengeance against the Tarquins and then killed herself in shame.

On the drawer above the door, gilt-bronze military trophies flank a medallion portrait of Louis XIV. In the Dutch Wars of 1672 - 1678, France fought simultaneously against the Dutch, Spanish, and Imperial armies, defeating them all. This cabinet celebrates the Treaty of Nijmegen, which concluded the war.

As it does not appear in inventories of his possessions, it may have served as a royal gift. The Sun King's portrait appears twice on this work. The bronze medallion above the central door was cast from a medal struck in 1661 which shows the king at the age of twenty-one.

"1415","tienne-Louis Boulle illustrated his love of pure geometrical solids in this design for part of a Neoclassical church: the spherical dome rests on the crossing of two cylindrical barrel vaults supported by an arcade of regularly spaced Corinthian columns. Classical details abound: coffering adorns the vaults, figurative sculptures fill niches in the wall, and tiny figures in togas carry fiery torches up to a pagan altar that belches smoke through the sacred space. Because of its expense and the impracticality of its vast size, this ambitious plan for the church of the Madeleine in Paris was never executed.After becoming an architect instead of a painter at the request of his father, Boulle regularly managed to include small painterly details in his architectural drawings. Using gradations of washes, he effectively suggested the dramatic effect of sunlight entering through the central dome, illuminating the altar, and creating dark shadows behind the columns. The intricate details and atmospheric touches, combined with an accurate rendering of architectural finishes, suggest that Boulle used this drawing to communicate his ideas to a client.","H:  2 ft. 4 in. x W:  11 1 4 in. x D:  4 1 2 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","French","The Wounding of Pyrrhus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11234701.jpg","Boucicaut Master","MS. 63, FOL. 131V"

When they continued to ask, Christ said,  He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.  The male accusers watch with varying expressions; some absorb Christ's words, while others recollect their own transgressions.Profoundly influenced by Caravaggio'srealismand dramatic lighting, Valentin de Boulogne used light and shadow and a shallow frieze-like arrangement of figures to convey the scene's emotion. Figures fade into the darkbackground, while faces, hands, and even a knee emerge from the dimness. The figures are highly individualized, especially the old man at the right who holds his glasses firmly to his nose in order to see better and the elderly man with the weathered face and scraggly hair who holds his cape back against his shoulder.

Abook of hoursis a privateprayer bookwith a core group of prayers and readings structured around the eight daily devotional services practiced by the clergy. Books of hours also contain a calendar of Church feasts, prayers to saints, and a service for the dead. They were designed for the laity and were frequently tailored to a patron's individual interests.Jean Bourdichon,court painterto four successive French kings, illuminated this book of hours, which represents some of his earliest work. He produced gloriousminiatureswith sophisticated landscapes, dramatic lighting, and monumental figures. Illuminations in books of hours, usually placed at the beginnings of the individual prayers, provided a visual focus, aiding the reader in his or her meditations.The intertwined initialsIandKappear frequently in the borders of themanuscript, with theIembraced by a loop that forms the arms of theK. The letters are probably the initials of a husband and wife who commissioned the book.

Bourdichon arranged the angels at the feet of the Virgin in an ellipse, but to offset the composition's symmetry, he twisted the axis of the crowning angels, further emphasizing the illusion of receding space. In this miniature, Bourdichon represented the divine light emanating from the Virgin as visible rays, which then softly model the draperies of the two angels and the faces of those below.","6 7 16 x 4 9 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","French","Jugurtha, King of Numidia, Thrown from His Roman Prison into the Tiber","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11235601.jpg","Boucicaut Master","MS. 63, FOL. 170"

Scholars call these scenes of men in fancy dress Anakreontic, after the poet Anakreon, who came to Athens from East Greece in the late 500s B.C.

Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C.

Horace Bristol made the photograph in a tent, either in a government-sponsored camp for migrant workers or in any one of a number of  Hoovervilles -the shantytowns named for President Herbert Hoover, who was blamed for the problems that led to the Great Depression.Bristol made this photograph while touring California's Central Valley with John Steinbeck. While Bristol made pictures, Steinbeck made copious notes. The research conducted on their trip contributed to Steinbeck's 1939 Pulitzer Prize winning novel,The Grapes of Wrath,an epic chronicle of one family's journey to California in search of farm work. Bristol's photographs were used extensively for casting when the book was made into a film in 1940. Named  Ma Joad  by Steinbeck, this woman was the backbone of her family, and the driving force behind their ability to get through the most difficult times.","9 11 16 x 7 3 4 in.","Oakveneeredwithamaranth, tulipwood, ebony, and holly, incised with red mastic; five soft-paste Svres porcelain plaques; gilt bronze mounts; white marble top","French","Secrtaire","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00657101.jpg","Martin Carlin","81.DA.80"
"1680","Emerging from a pea field in California's Central Valley, migrant farm workers paid by the pound carry their harvest to a roadside scale. Horace Bristol made this photograph while traveling through the Central Valley with author John Steinbeck. Bristol had approached Steinbeck about collaborating on a book length project about California's farm workers. They spent five or six weekends together, interviewing workers and making photographs in labor camps and on the road. Steinbeck then withdrew from the project to concentrate on what would become his Pulitzer Prize winning novel,The Grapes of Wrath.Though his original collaboration with Steinbeck was abandoned, the photographs that Bristol had made appeared inLIFEmagazine shortly after the 1939 publication of The Grapes of Wrath. Bristol's images were used in casting producer Darryl Zanuck's film version of Steinbeck's novel. Bristol's images appeared inLIFEagain upon the film's release. These once-famous photographs remained in storage, nearly forgotten to the world, until 1985, when Bristol's son asked him if he had readThe Grapes of Wrath. This image is one of only forty surviving photographs from Steinbeck and Bristol's now immortal journey through California's Central Valley.","7 1 4 x 9 1 4 in.","Oak veneered with ebony, pewter, tortoiseshell, brass, ivory, horn, and various woods; with drawers of snake wood; painted and gilded wood figures; bronze mounts","French","Cabinet on Stand","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00632801.jpg","Andr-Charles Boulle","77.DA.1"

During the 1930s, such substandard living conditions were common. Another car, a tent, and a line of sheds can be seen in the distance. The Dust Bowl-a period of severe drought that struck the Great Plains of the United States in the early 1930s-and the Great Depression forced many Midwestern families off their land. In search of farm work, the only labor they knew, families headed west to California, Oregon, and Washington. Shantytowns like this, nicknamed Hoovervilles after the president blamed for the Depression, sprung up wherever people stopped in hope of work.

AnX-rayof the painting shows that he first painted the hands higher and more horizontally across the head; he then probably worked out the position in this drawing and returned to rework the painting.","10 1 2 x 11 in.","Oakveneeredwith ebony, tortoiseshell, pewter, brass, ivory, horn, various stained and natural woods;giltbronzemounts","French","Table","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00664201.jpg","Andr-Charles Boulle","83.DA.22"

One of those artists, Agnolo Bronzino, made this drawing as a study of the right hand of one of those sculptures. With precision he copied the crisscross pattern of the accentuated veins and even the square thumbnail.In order to make this study, Bronzino must somehow have raised himself to the level of the hand, since it is drawn straight on and close-up and not from a low viewpoint. Perhaps he used steps to gain a better view or made the study from a cast of the hand. He combined more than one view of the three-dimensional hand, including both the upper surface of the thumb and the bulging muscle along the lower contour of the hand, which in reality cannot be seen at the same time. This gave difficulties when he tried to foreshorten the crooked forefinger, and faint traces of an early attempt still remain.In contrast to the careful presentation on the recto, the draftsman swiftly and spontaneously sketched four heads on the verso of this sheet.","7 3 4 x 8 in.","Walnut and oakveneeredwith ebony, tortoiseshell, pewter, brass, and painted blue horn; gilt bronzemounts","French","Pair of Gueridons","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00679801.jpg","Andr-Charles Boulle","87.DA.5"

His torso twists to bring it parallel with his bent leg and arm, thus exposing a portion of his back. Although unnaturally posed, Agnolo Bronzino'sserpentinefigure of Saint John achieves a graceful fluidity typical of the style calledMannerism.The unusually tall format of this work results from its original position as the left panel of thealtarpiecein the private chapel of Eleonora da Toldeo in the Palazzo Vecchio.

"1700","Using delicate chalk strokes, Agnolo Bronzino built up the head of a young Florentine nobleman. Soft, careful lines create the curling strands of hair on his head, the pale fuzz on his chin, and his broad, piercing, almond-shaped eyes with their large irises. Numerous lines of cross-hatching create the darker shadows on the right side of the face and the long, elegant neck. Bronzino probably made this drawing from life; slight pentimenti in the right ear and eye imply adjustments made in front of the live model.Bronzino drew this head as a study for a painted portrait of the young man, but no one has yet discovered the man's name. Technical analysis of the painting reveals that he made numerous changes on the canvas as he developed his composition. The Getty Museum's drawing therefore gives scholars an important idea of the artist's earliest conception of the portrait, probably even before he began to paint.","6 3 8 x 4 11 16 in.","Walnutveneeredwith brass, pewter, tortoiseshell, and ebony;giltbronzemounts","French","Two Coffers on Stands","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00661801.jpg","Andr-Charles Boulle","82.DA.109"
"1710 - 1715","Gazing out for eternity, the man depicted on this Romano-Egyptian mummy portrait holds the symbols of his salvation. He has a glass filled with red liquid, presumably wine. Wine, and the color red in general, was associated with life in Egyptian thought and more specifically with rebirth in a funerary context. The garland of pink flowers in his other hand marks the man as an initiate in the cult of the goddess Isis, who offered her followers a happy, carefree afterlife.Although scholars do not know where this portrait was excavated, several features match those of portraits from Er-Rubayat in the Fayum. The angular trimmed upper corners of the panel correspond to the way embalmers at this site cut down portrait panels to make them fit in the mummy wrappings. The portrait is painted in the frontal, unrealistic style favored at Er-Rubayat. Although it is difficult to convey three-dimensionality in the tempera technique, the Brooklyn Painter carefully used shadows andhighlightsto give a sense of depth to the man's face.","3 x 6 in.","Pine and oak veneered with ebony, brass, and tortoiseshell; gilt bronzemounts","French","Pair of Pedestals","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00682501.jpg","Andr-Charles Boulle","88.DA.75"
"1710","The surprising truncated effect of this drawing, in which a pleated skirt illogically stands on its own, indicates that Hans Brosamer probably drew it on a live model and simply omitted the body. As this drapery study does not relate to any known painting or print by Brosamer, he probably drew it for his own interest and practical experience.Brosamer's practice of drawing objects from life and his use of contemporary clothing as subject matter show that he was abreast of the artistic trends of his own period. At the same time, his tendency to treat individual pieces of drapery as self-contained outlined forms illustrates his delight in the complex folds of cloth alone.

Bats and birds soar across the sky, receding into thebackgroundwhere brighter skies hold promise of a future.The story of Noah's ark provided a subject well suited to Jan Brueghel the Elder's descriptive abilities. Overcome by the wickedness of the human race, God resolved to cleanse the earth with a great flood. He spared only the lives of the family of Noah, the sole just man. God instructed Noah to build an ark and to take on board a male and a female of every species of bird and beast.In 1609 Brueghel was appointedcourt paintertoArchduke Albertand theInfanta Isabella, who had collected exotic and unusual animals from across the world, creating a menagerie in Brussels. Brueghel studied and drew many of these animals from life. With the discovery of the New World in the 1600s came an increased curiosity about natural history. This interest led many European rulers, who had in the past collected stuffed animals, shells, and other natural objects, to form menageries of rare live animals.","10 1 2 x 14 1 2 in.","Oakveneeredwith tortoiseshell, brass, and ebony; gilt-bronzemounts;sarrancolin des Pyrenesmarble top","French","Medal Cabinet","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00669301.jpg","Andr-Charles Boulle","84.DA.58"

The fish flowing from the water jug and the cornucopia of abundance cradled in the arms of the figure on the right correspond to the tactile elements of water and earth. The birds in the sky and trees and the accoutrements of battle in the foreground correspond to the intangible elements of fire and air. The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape.Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers.

The factory reused Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze casting molds, replicating theBaroquesculptor's muscular figures, wind-blown dramatic draperies, and dynamiccompositions. Yet the painting, using jewel-like yellow, purple, blue, and pinkpigmentsandgilding, brings out a spirited delicacy more typical of theRococostyle of the mid-1700s. As a result, Medusa, whose horrifying look was reputed to turn men to stone, is merely a rather startlingly rosy-cheeked woman with snakes for hair, while Argus, the hundred-eyed giant who tormented Jupiter's lover Io, is a handsome, muscled warrior.Each figural group is made from ten separate sections, each of which was press-molded and fired before being joined together. The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum.

Small spherical pearls hang from the ends of the foliage, suspended from small loops so that they could swing freely. In the Renaissance, goldsmiths began to experiment with a variety of new cuts for gemstones. A table-cut stone rests on top of the owl's head, and three others lie along the branch at the bird's feet. The intricate and unusual cuts of the jewels on either side of the owl, in the shape of a quatrefoil and a rosette, suggest that someone commissioned this drawing to show a possible setting for actual stones.Contemporary paintings and drawings reveal that pendants were among the most popular forms of jewelry in the Renaissance. Women in particular favored pendants, wearing them suspended from a chain around their necks or pinned to a sleeve, where the dangling pearls and sparkling gemstones would catch the eye with their movement and brilliance.","20 3 4 x 32 in.","Pen and gray ink and black, pink, and gray washes","French","Architectural Project for the Church of the Madeleine","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00007801.jpg","tienne-Louis Boulle","84.GA.53"
"1480 - 1485","Komasts or revelers frolic around the exterior of this Athenianred-figurecup. The men dance and hold drinking cups, while female attendants provide the music. The unusual feature of this vase is the odd way the men are dressed. They wear longchitonsand turban-like headdresses, and attendants shelter them with parasols. Several dozen vases with similarly dressed revelers survive. Scholars call these scenes of men in fancy dress Anakreontic, after the poet Anakreon, who came to Athens from East Greece in the late 500s B.C. Scholars do not agree on how to interpret this costume. Because the men's clothing is similar to that of the women in the scene, some scholars see the men as transvestites dressing up as women. Other scholars point out that this clothing was suitable male attire in the Greek colonies on the coast of Turkey and in the neighboring kingdom of Lydia. They see the adoption of Eastern dress forsymposia, or drinking parties, as part of a larger infiltration of East Greek art and ideas into Athenian culture beginning in the 520s B.C.

Ajax was one of the greatest of the Greek heroes in theTrojan War. The matter of his suicide was recounted in epic poetry now lost to us, but Athenian vase-painters in the early 400s B.C. frequently drew on this tradition in showing his death.The interior of thisred-figurecup attributed to the Brygos Painter shows Ajax impaled on his sword and Tekmessa running to cover the body. In a unique representation of the suicide, the sword enters through his back rather than the more natural position through the stomach. Beneath Ajax, the Brygos Painter attempted to convey the texture of the pebble beach where Ajax went to die.The exterior of the cup presents the events leading to Ajax's suicide. When Achilles was killed, Ajax saved his body from the Trojans, expecting to be rewarded with Achilles' armor. However,Odysseusalso claimed the armor.

The lyre in one hand and the phorbeia, a face-strap used by flute players, that he holds over the altar identify him as a musician. The act of offering gifts to the gods was an essential element of Greek religion. Although pious worshippers could give animal sacrifices, libations or liquid offerings, or elaborate, expensive gifts, the gods also appreciated small items of great personal importance. Greeks made such offerings when praying for something to occur or in thanks for a good outcome. This scene may represent a youth asking for, or giving thanks for, a victory in one of the frequent musical contests in which well-bred Athenian young men competed.Although the depiction of a religious ritual on a cup used at a drinking party may seem odd today, the Greeks saw no conflict in this. For the Greeks, the drinking and merriment of the symposion was itself an offering toDionysos, the god of wine.","4 7 16 x 12 3 8 in.","Temperacolors and gold onparchment","French","King David in Prayer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00184901.jpg","Jean Bourdichon","MS. 48, FOL. 98"

The troops had gathered on a mud-covered hillside, which they had used as a makeshift First Aid center while attempting to take areas known as Hills 400 and 484. While this image focuses on the bandaged, bloodied African-American soldier in the center, diagonally positioned limbs of men on the left side of the image direct attention to a mud-covered soldier lying injured on the ground.Photojournalist Larry Burrows framed this image in a manner that emphasizes an apocalyptic, scorched earth in the colors of brown and muted cyan. But there is a hint of vividness in the bright white, bloodstained bandage of a soldier centered in the picture. Prior to Vietnam, war images were typically made using black and white film, so Burrows use of color enhances the impact of this scene.More than any other war until then, the Vietnam conflict was brought to American citizens through the eyes of photojournalists. Their poignant and arresting imagery in magazines likeLifeandLook,television, and newspapers gave Americans an unromantic vision of daily warfare.

Though even her horses shy away from the deed she is about to perform, Tullia seems determined to finish the job of completely destroying her father.Focusing on the horror of the scene--taken from the Roman historian Livy--Giuseppe Cades crammed the composition full of figures and movement. The horses rear, manes streaming out, and Tullia and her groom gesture at the body of Servius, their capes billowing in the wind. The use of white heightening, which illuminates the flowing mane and muscular body of the central horse and the murdered king's body, amplifies the dramatic effect of the darkened scene.Scholars believe that Cades made the drawing to be sold as an independent work of art rather than in preparation for a painting.

He rendered the sitter's face--where the sitter's character is most fully revealed--with great care, while the clothes, hair, and especially the back of the head were treated more sketchily. These areas show the sculptor's handling of the clay, creating incised lines on the front of the clothes and smooth planes on the cheeks. Although the sitter's identity is unknown, the face closely resembles portraits of the painter Franois Boucher.Made to adorn a French interior, this type of bust was very popular in the 1700s.

His prominent nose, furrowed forehead, bushy eyebrows, and soft, aging flesh suggest a sympathetic, kind disposition. To suggest informality, Jean-Jacques Caffieri left the surface rough and rendered the sitter in casual garb. Caffieri, who was known for his portraitbustsof contemporary celebrities, especially those of writers and artists, represented Taitbout as one of theliterati, even outfitting him in the loose blouse worn by artists and writers. He modeled the bust interracotta, taking advantage of the medium's flexibility to render a portrait striking in its spontaneity. The intimacy of this portrait is characteristic of the Enlightenment interest in psychology. Indeed, the portrait's psychological penetration suggests that the sitter or a close intimate probably commissioned it.Taitbout was an aristocrat, a knight of the order of Saint-Lazare, who served as French general consul to Alger, Algeria and then to Naples. The sculptor likely modeled the portrait from life and chose to memorialize Taitbout's warm humanity.","25 x 9 13 16 in.","Oil on canvas","American","Samson with the Jawbone","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00057201.jpg","Salomon de Bray","69.PA.23"

Outerbridge's not-quite-natural color photographs inspired Callis to use color for her own expressive images.

"1938","I wanted to take familiar objects and combine them in a way [in which] one might see them in new relationships to each other. The relationships can be a bit incongruous, but they at least make sense on a visual level. The pictures can be metaphorical, of ordinary occurrences in life existing at the same time as the extraordinary.--Jo Ann CallisIn this unconventional  still life,  three separate black-and-white images are printed side-by-side on a single sheet of photographic paper. From left to right, three images present individual items: a white cake on a glass plate, a light-grey Fedora hat, and a round, white pillow. Jo Ann Callis says ofCake, Hat, Pillow:  I didn't want any one of the objects in the composition to be more important than any other, so I had to separate them and give each its own independent space. These particular subjects were selected because they look very similar in the way they are photographed--and in their shape--but their meanings are quite different from one another. Domestic objects fascinate me because we see them all the time and we have strong associations with them. Referring to the combined black-and-white still life studies made in 1982-83 asThe Gridseries, Callis selected familiar household objects that, individually, gave her comfort. By combining these objects and adding strong, focused overhead lighting, she infused drama or an imagined conversation, between the objects. The resulting assemblages cause the viewer to give common objects new weight and, perhaps, new meaning.","10 15 16 x 14 1 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Pea Pickers Weighing Barrels","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13771201.jpg","Horace Bristol","2000.22.18"

How one appears to the outside world may be different from what one feels internally.--Jo Ann CallisIn the mid-1980s, Jo Ann Callis created a series of images that featured human figures in movement. The anonymity of the people in these fictitious scenes enables viewers to identify with them and share their seeming conflict or anxiety. The scenes she created were often domestic, and the models were dressed to carry out seemingly ordinary routines. Occasionally taking this idea of performance photography to its logical extreme, she asked her models to do magic or sideshow tricks in highly theatrical sets featuring spotlighting, heavy gold drapery, and purple backdrops. In this example, Callis invented what she called a  kind of metaphor for life.  Her young model has the agility to do a handstand with no apparent strain, yet her intent, Callis says, was to have the woman  look as if she were at ease while at the same time . . . performing something that is difficult for her to carry off.

"1530 - 1540","This powerful image clearly displays Jacques Callot developing the motif of a rearing horse. He first laid out the sheet horizontally, with the present left side at the top, and lightly sketched the back of the head of a horse in the center of the page. He then turned the sheet vertically and drew the whole animal with a fine, quill pen. Finally, Callot went back over the outlines with a thicker reed pen, adding emphasis and creating a sense of rippling movement with dark, sure strokes. The streaming mane and tail and the unusual vertical format emphasize the upward movement of the rearing horse.Upon completing the large stallion, Callot returned to the quill pen to execute the tiny equine figure in the lower right. More fluid still, the horse and rider capture the movements of its larger counterpart in remarkable detail, down to the glimpse of the underside of the front left hoof between the horse's hind legs. The drawing demonstrates Callot's marvelous capacity to miniaturizemotifsin a dashing, shorthand manner.","10 7 16 x 8 1 2 in.","Temperaon wood","Flemish","Mummy Portrait of a Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00992101.jpg","Brooklyn Painter","79.AP.142"
"1598","Jacques Callot's bravura handling ofwash, the expansiveness of the setting, and the large number of participants belie this sheet's tiny size. Callot typically created small prints and drawings whose action and setting may be best appreciated with a magnifying glass.The location and subject depicted in this drawing are unknown, but the camels indicate an Eastern locale. With rich use of wash and dramatic compositional rhythms, Callot invented a complex scene of an army marching in procession from a castle or walled city with captives and booty. Banners aloft, they regroup to trumpet fanfares in the lower right corner. Huge tongues of flame, seen clearly in the black chalk underdrawing, burst from the battlements.In style, subject, and horizontal format, this drawing resembles compositions from one of Callot's masterworks, hisMiseries of Waretchings of 1633. He completed the series soon after Cardinal Richelieu's devastating invasion of the Lorraine region and the capture of Callot's hometown of Nancy.","11 1 2 x 8 13 16 in.","Pen and black ink","Flemish","Study of a Pleated Skirt","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00037001.jpg","Hans Brosamer","92.GA.2"
"1610 - 1612","Jacques Callot often featured complex and highly expressive rock formations in his prints and drawings. Only through sensitive observation of natural phenomena was he able to capture a wide range of effects of light and shade with an economical, rhythmic use ofwash. Remarkably, despite his freedom and fluidity in applying wash, there is no evidence that he was ever a painter.The forthrightness and simplicity with which Callot described forms on the page and his masterly use of light reveal experiments in landscape parallel to those of his two great French contemporaries, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. Both Poussin and Claude lived in Italy, where Callot worked from 1612 to 1621.While this drawing's purpose is not known, both it and Callot'sAn Army Leaving a Castlemay have been studies for engravings that were never made.","9 1 2 in.","Pen and black ink","Flemish","Study of a Hanging Drapery","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00037101.jpg","Hans Brosamer","92.GA.3"
"1613","On the paper on which this print is mounted, Julia Margaret Cameron inscribed the words:  My very first success in Photography.  Cameron had received her first camera as a gift just one month before writing these words. Like most photographers of the time, she struggled with the mechanical operation of the camera and the chemistry involved to create an image.In the 1860s, photographers were required to work rapidly because all of the chemicals had to be used while they were still fresh. They had to compose the subject for the photograph, hoping the sitter could maintain his or her pose long enough for them to make the exposure. The complexity and urgency of the process led to many technical mistakes, and Cameron's early attempts were no exception. Even though the sitter's face is slightly out of focus, and streaks from the application of the chemistry are evident, it was with great pride and satisfaction that Cameron declared this portrait of tousle-haired Annie Philpot to be the first completed print that she considered successful.","10 x 7 13 16 in.","Oil on copper","Italian","The Sermon on the Mount","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00085701.jpg","Jan Brueghel the Elder","84.PC.71"

His heavy jowls touch his collar, and his white bowtie echoes the tome's shape. Julia Margaret Cameron's image of Jowett, like other photographs she made of prominent men, suggests reverence bordering on hero-worship.In addition to Jowett's bookish appearance, Cameron captured his eccentric personality: He was, in fact, a man with unorthodox views. For a decade, Jowett taught the Classics at Oxford University until his dismissal on grounds that his religious beliefs were too radical. Jowett rented a cottage on the Isle of Wight to work on translations of Plato and be near his and Cameron's mutual friend, Alfred, Lord Tennyson.","10 1 2 x 8 3 8 in.","Oil on panel","Netherlandish","The Return from War: Mars Disarmed by Venus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14017601.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","2000.68"

As Cameron sits in an armchair facing his wife's camera, his white hair is drenched in brilliant natural light. Although it is winter and he is bundled in an overcoat, his eyes express tender warmth.This portrait by Julia Margaret Cameron is a rare study of her husband, and one of the first she made after taking up photography. In her later allegorical images, Charles Hay Cameron's patriarchal appearance made him a convincing King Lear and Merlin. But in real life, he fit the Victorian archetype of  genius  with his unruly white hair, as did many of the scholarly men his wife photographed. Cameron attended Eton College and served a distinguished law career in British colonial India. He shared a passion for literature and philosophy with his wife and friends. He also had a tendency to be reclusive. Here, he is portrayed simply as himself--a gentle and solitary man.","11 1 16 x 8 15 16 in.","Oil on panel","Greek","The Entry of the Animals into Noah's Ark","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00103401.jpg","Jan Brueghel the Elder","92.PB.82"

Terry had married the portrait painter George Frederick Watts, who was thirty years her senior; the marriage, orchestrated by Cameron and her sisters, was a brief and unhappy union.Terry's forlorn expression and nervous gesture may be an actress's performance put on for the camera. Her demeanor, indicated by the titleSadness, which Cameron gave to another print of this image, may also indicate Terry's realization that her marriage was a mistake. Employing a non-fading print process used for commercially distributed pictures, Cameron's printer made multiplecarbon printsavailable for purchase by Terry's and Cameron's fans.","10 1 4 x 8 7 16 in.","Oil on panel","Greek","Landscape with Ceres (Allegory of Earth)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00064401.jpg","Jan Brueghel the Younger","71.PB.29"

The models are Freddie Gould and Elizabeth Keown, local children from the Isle of Wight, where Julia Margaret Cameron photographed. The novel centers around a shipwreck, during which the heroine must shed her clothes to be rescued; she refuses to sacrifice her modesty and drowns. Cameron does not attempt to illustrate an actual scene from the text; instead, she suggests the novel's tropical setting through a bamboo-handled parasol, scattered greenery underfoot, and the models' appropriately disheveled drapery. Cameron often took well-known works of literature or painting as inspiration for individual images and then interpreted them loosely to communicate a universal underlying theme.","10 11 16 x 8 3 4 in.","Oil on panel","Greek","Landscape with Allegories of the Four Elements","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00064301.jpg","Jan Brueghel the Younger","71.PB.28"
"480 - 470","Cameron found in the camera a tool to express her beliefs in the idealizing and transformative power of art. Cameron portrayed her family and intimate friends, directing them to stage her own imagery. The British poet Henry Taylor was an important model for her. Here he appears as Prospero from Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Cameron's pictorial exploration of the medium, her rejection of conventional focus, and her theatrical use of light were atypical for the time.","13 5 16 x 10 3 8 in.","Porcelain, polychrome, and parcel gilt","American","Mercury and Argus and Perseus and Medusa","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00147801.jpg","Ginori Porcelain Factory","94.SE.76"

Julia Margaret Cameron may have decided to include a fourth figure, the young girl at the left, to add pictorial balance to the composition. The girl may represent an angel, as her outstretched hand hovering above the infant's head appears to be a gesture of blessing. The sleeping child's peaceful repose is emphasized by the contemplative silence of the surrounding figures. A spiritual calm is conveyed in the image by the adults' downcast eyes. Cameron powerfully evokes the mood of the Nativity scene through her careful, sensitive rendering of a sacred subject.","13 15 16 x 10 3 4 in.","Pen and black ink and brown wash","British","Design for a Pendant Jewel","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00028101.jpg","Theodor de Bry","89.GA.20"
"480","George Frederick Watts was a renowned portrait painter as well as a friend and mentor to the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Cameron photographed Watts frequently and in different guises. Here she cast him in the role of musician with hismuseor guiding spirit looking intently over his left shoulder, as though she is  whispering  some artistic encouragement in his ear. He, in turn, looks down upon the figure of the child on his right, who appears to be entranced by his violin playing.The violin is the visual focus of the composition and establishes a connection between the visual and performing arts. The concept of  muse  derives from Greek mythology and indicates the influence ofclassicalsources in Cameron's work. On the mount board under this image, her inscription,  a Triumph!,  demonstrates the degree to which she felt this photograph captured the relationship of artist and muse.","14 7 16 x 10 3 16 in.","Terracotta","French","Wine Cup with Flirtation Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01416601.jpg","Briseis Painter","86.AE.293"
"1917","Come into the garden, Maud, I am here at the gate alone; And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad, And the musk of the rose is blown.-Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in MaudThe woman in the garden is a common theme ofVictorianpoetry and painting, often representing beauty andromanticlove. Magdalene Brookfield, a family friend of Julia Margaret Cameron, is the dark-haired woman strolling through this garden. Her pyramid-shaped figure is centered in the photograph, and so is Cameron's focus. Brookfield's face, hand, and a part of a nearby bush are sharply defined. The rest of the image blends into soft-focus, emphasizing her mysterious, pointing gesture.Perhaps Magdalene represents the subject of a man's obsession, as in Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1855 poem, Maud, in which the ephemeral qualities of love and a woman's beauty are ascribed to nature. Like Eve in the Garden of Eden, the woman in nature becomes part of a moral theme of the virtuous woman versus the fallen woman. Cameron probably made this outdoor, full-figure study at the London home of her sister, Sara Prinsep.","12 3 4 x 10 1 2 in.","Terracotta","French","Wine Cup with the Suicide of Ajax","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01415901.jpg","Brygos Painter","86.AE.286"

We visited the Colonna and Doria palaces, where the portraits of Beatrice were to be found; and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story.--Mrs. Percy ShelleyJulia Margaret Cameron often directed female models to represent tragic heroines whose sorrow made them beautiful. Cameron composed this image around the sitter's downcast eyes and scrolling hair--which spills out from under a turban. Cameron's niece, May Prinsep, plays the role of Beatrice, the central figure of Percy Bysshe Shelley's play, The Cenci (1819). Prinsep's sorrowful expression conveys the character's resignation to her fate.Beatrice Cenci, the daughter of a Roman count, lived in Florence during the late 1500s. After Beatrice conspired with her mother and brother to have her father killed, the trial brought to light his cruelty, which included an attempt to rape her. Although the story won public sympathy, the family was nonetheless executed. Cameron was fascinated by this true story and made several photographic studies based on it.","10 15 16 x 8 11 16 in.","Terracotta","French","Wine Cup with a Boy Dedicating the Mouth Strap of a Wind Instrument","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01416101.jpg","Brygos Painter","86.AE.288"
"1270-1280","The astronomer Sir John Frederick William Herschel was a lifelong friend of Julia Margaret Cameron. They met in 1835 in South Africa, where Cameron was recovering from an illness and Herschel was conducting astronomical investigations. Herschel was not only a preeminent astronomer but also made several significant discoveries in photographic processes, most notably the invention of thecyanotypeblueprint.Even before she began to make photographs, Cameron kept apprised of discoveries in photography through her correspondence with Herschel. In this portrait of her dear friend, Cameron sought to portray  faithfully the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man.  Cameron draped Herschel in a swath of dark cloth, which served to highlight his white hair and to focus attention on his face. Herschel's unruly hair and eyebrows and fiery eyes are features commonly ascribed to a popular image of  genius ; they effectively convey strength of character and intellectual intensity.","13 7 16 x 10 5 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Dancing Lesson, the  Mazurka ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04410001.jpg","Karl Bulla","84.XP.224.54"

She had to wait long and patiently, however, for the chance to capture the historian Thomas Carlyle with her lens. Carlyle, famous for writingOn Heroes, Hero-Worship and the Heroic in History, sat for Cameron only once, and during the sitting she made two photographs: this frontal portrait and a profile view.Carlyle's face is cast in deep shadow. The dramatic lighting, which both illuminates and obscures his face, gives the portrait an emotional intensity. Carlyle was an intellectual hero to Cameron. Believing she had successfully captured him in a heroic posture, Cameron inscribed some prints of this image with the caption:  Carlyle like a rough block of Michelangelo's sculpture.  This powerful, head-on view reveals a strength and intensity of character that mirrors the straightforward, sometimes antagonistic discourses in his writing.","11 9 16 x 10 1 2 in.","Dye transfer print","French","Mutter Ridge, Nui Cay Tri, South Vietnam","www.getty.edu art collections images l 25743001.jpg","Larry Burrows","2004.154"

Cameron's virtuoso lighting captures the sculptural qualities of her model's ample physique, throwing the contours of the face into highrelief. Wilson's bright forehead and the bridge of her nose form one surface plane, her cheeks, another. Her skin resembles the luminance of marble.Cameron may have gained inspiration from the Elgin Marbles--Greek sculptural reliefs from thefriezeof the Parthenon--as did many artists in the 1800s. Around the time of this photograph, Wilson posed for two photographs that Cameron composed after the Marbles.Greekclassicismalso inspired Cameron's mythological subject: A bacchante is a female follower of the wine and fertility god,Bacchus. In this image the bacchante is represented in ceremonial attire, with star-shaped jewelry symbolizing her flamboyant nature.","14 1 4 x 10 1 2 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, and iron gall ink on parchment bound between wood boards covered with red velvet","French","Bute Psalter","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00180601.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46"

Cameron's admiration of Jackson is evident in the many portraits she made of Jackson; in fact, she was Cameron's most frequent subject.Here Cameron depicted Jackson in the year of her first marriage. She is shown at the height of her beauty, before later tragedies, including her husband's premature death, brought a solemnity and melancholy to her face. Cameron employs the same strong directional lighting that she used in her portrait of Thomas Carlyle, casting half of the subject's face in deep shadow.","12 7 8 x 10 in.","Tempera colors and gold leaf on parchment","French","Initial D: The Anointing of David","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00187801.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46, FOL. 32V"

In this profile portrait, Julia Jackson appears heroic and stately, as a girl on the verge of womanhood. She faces the light, which brilliantly illuminates her and metaphorically suggests the enlightenment Cameron believed marriage would bring to her. Cameron trimmed the photograph to the oval shape, creating an intimate frame for the subject.Only a few years after this photograph was made, the marriage ended tragically with Herbert Duckworth's sudden death. Jackson later remarried and bore two children, the painter Vanessa Bell and the writer Virginia Woolf. Jackson was the model for the character of Mrs. Ramsay in Woolf's 1927 novelTo the Lighthouse.","12 3 4 x 10 3 4 in.","Tempera colors and gold leaf on parchment","French","Initial D: David Pointing to His Mouth","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00187901.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46, FOL. 52V"

She photographed influential public figures of her day as well as the women of her household, casting them in allegories of literary and religious subjects. Like her artistic contemporaries, the Pre-Raphaelite painters, who modeled their work on medieval religious and mythological art, Cameron intended her photographs to evince a connection between the spiritual and the natural realms.","13 1 8 x 10 5 8 in.","Tempera colors and gold leaf on parchment","French","Initial Q: A Priest Stabbed by a Soldier","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00188001.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46, FOL. 71"

Marie Spartali is centered in the frame, creating a symmetry that adds a sense of calm to her contemplative expression. Similar shades of gray visually echo one another--like Spartali's pinned-up hair, full lips, and the flower detail on her dress.Although Spartali's specific physical traits are blurred, Julia Margaret Cameron did not intend to represent her as an ambiguous,allegoricalfigure. Cameron liked to pose her Anglo-Greek friend in roles fromclassicalmythology. In this case, the photograph's title declares the sitter's true identity. Perhaps that is because, in addition to modeling for severalVictorianpainters, Spartali was an accomplished artist in her own right.","13 15 16 x 11 1 16 in.","Tempera colors and gold leaf on parchment","Spanish","Initial S: The Lord Appearing to David in the Water","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00188201.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46, FOL. 92"

This is how we felt, for we never knew what Aunt Julia was going to do next.--Laura (Gurney) TroubridgeYoung Rachel Gurney's forlorn expression does not quite fit her role as an angel, but in a humorous way, her performance supports this photograph's staged look. She is perched on a box that is covered loosely in drapery and positioned stiffly on a table, with fake wings attached to her. Resting her chin on her crossed arms, she appears resigned to her fate of posing for the camera.Julia Margaret Cameron made a suite of photographs based onputtifromRenaissanceand post-Renaissance paintings.

"1759","Cameron was surrounded by children and identified strongly with her role as a mother. Children made natural subjects for her work because they were readily available, and she could easily cajole them into participation. She often cast them as angels, viewing the young as closer to God due to their proximity in years from birth. Here Cameron posed a maternal Venus, played by her maid Mary Hillier, attending to a sleepy cupid.","9 15 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Tempera colors and gold leaf on parchment","Italian","Initial E: David Playing the Harp","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11048101.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46, FOL. 61V"
"1665 - 1670","Cameron would have been interested in that notion of theholy familyas working class, humble, peasant people.

At least that may have been Julia Margaret Cameron's intention as part of her strategy to elevate photography to the status of high-art. By contrast, Cameron's subjects--the Madonna with infants Jesus and John the Baptist--appear humble in their simple clothing and quiet demeanor.Cameron's interest in the working-class origins of the Holy Family stemmed from contemporary biblical scholarship and art that focused on the historical context of Christ's life, frequently portraying him as a carpenter's son.","H:  32 3 4 in.","6 11 16 x 4 11 16 in.","French","Initial M: David's Theft of the Spear and Chalice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11048401.jpg","Bute Master","MS. 46, FOL. 75V"

A friend and neighbor of Cameron at Freshwater, Tennyson published the collection of poems in 1872; the poems had taken him nearly forty years to write. The images that Cameron created for theIdyllsare the most illustrative works she made; she took great care with the details of costumes and props to insure the photographs' faithfulness to his narrative. She employed a variety of people as models, going to great lengths to ensure the appropriateness of sitter to subject. This image depicts the final embrace of the tragic lovers before they are forever parted:And Lancelot ever promised, but remain'd,And still they met and met. Again she said, O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence, And then they were agreed upon a night(When the good King should not be there)to meetAnd part forever, Passion-pale they metAnd greeted; hands in hands, and eye to eye,Low on the border of her couch they satStammering and staring; it was their lasthour,A madness of farewells.","11 3 4 x 7 1 4 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, pink and green ground colors, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","French","Pair of Cups and Saucers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00623401.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","72.DE.74"

Her widower, Charles Norman, is seated in the center with their two daughters. In their mother's absence, the daughters emotionally support their father. With their arms entwined around him and hands clasped near his heart, they envelop him in a tender, comforting embrace. Cameron probably directed this gesture, which adds great emotional impact.Family was the cornerstone of Cameron's art and life. This and other photographs of the Normans represent a bonding among the remaining family. Making the series may have helped Cameron cope with her sense of loss. It was Charles and Julia Norman's gift of a camera that became the catalyst for her photography.

The child's legs are tucked close to her body, and her arms are folded protectively around her waist. Julia Margaret Cameron's tight framing confines the subject within a small space, making her slight unease more noticeable. But the full-figurecompositionalso suggests a distance between photographer and subject that is both physical and cultural.Cameron made this photograph near the end of her life, when she lived in what is now Sri Lanka. This Tamil child may have been the daughter of a worker on her family's estate. Although Cameron had a benevolent attitude toward the Ceylonese, she supported the British Empire's civilizing mission in Asia, as was typical of her time.

The sculpture was cast in one piece using thelost wax process. As in his other works, the sculptor Girolamo Campagna conveyed a sense of movement through the organization of the figure's body. The boy's torso twists gently while his arms and legs move in opposite directions, suggesting motion rather than a static pose. In contrast to the body's sensuous modeling, especially at the hips, thighs and ankles, the boy's face is defined by the smooth planes of his high forehead and heavy-lidded eyes.","17 x 11 1 2 in.","Pen and brown ink and white and graybodycolorover black chalk on gray prepared paper","French","Tullia about to Ride over the Body of Her Father in Her Chariot","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00050201.jpg","Giuseppe Cades","95.GA.25"

One day, a small child seemed to grow heavier and heavier as Christopher waded through the current. The child finally revealed himself as Christ and told the saint that he had been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.Deftly handling the point of the quill, Campagnola indicated both the lighting and volume of the saint's muscular body simply by varying the length and curve of the same strokes of parallel hatching.

"1760","Elaborate stone fixtures carved by the ancient Romans inspired Renaissance artists to create complex decorations called candelabra. These ornamental forms were usually composed of elements drawn from metalwork and architecture. On this sheet, Domenico Campagnola created three designs from stacked vases and pedestals, alternately upright and overturned. He then arranged combinations of putti, human figures, trailing foliage, and bucrania around each form.Artists designed such intricate candelabra not just as functional objects like candle or torch supports; they also appeared as decorative motifs. Such forms ornamented the margins of printed books and filled the edges of frescoes. Parallel hatched lines down the sides of each candelabrum in this drawing give each form a sense of depth. But the clarity of the lines also suggests that the drawings could have transferred for engravings. Pattern books containing prints organized by their ornamental themes became popular in the Renaissance, when craftsmen used these books to create ornaments in a variety of media.","12 1 2 x 22 3 8 in.","Giltbronze","French","Four Wall Lights","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00668301.jpg","Jacques Caffieri","84.DF.41"

Decorated with statues and representations of his famous deeds and insignia, these arches marked the ruler's route through the city gates to his lodgings. The number ofpentimentiin this rapidly drawn work suggests to scholars that Campi completed the drawing in some haste, probably working under a tight deadline. For example, he produced two further alternatives for the position of the head, both in profile and tilted farther back, but he did not bother to reinforce either in darker chalk.","H:  33 3 8 in.","Microscope ofgiltbronze, enamel,shagreen, glass; case of wood,tooledand gilded leather, brass, lined with velvet, silver braid, and silver lace","French","Compound Microscope and Case","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00678901.jpg","Jacques Caffieri","86.DH.694"

A crescent visible below her skirts at the left symbolizes the moon on which the Virgin stands in representations of the Immaculate Conception. The open and closed books symbolize the Old and New Testaments, and the lilies to the right symbolize Mary's purity. The apple in Christ's hands and mouth alludes to original sin and his future sacrifice.In this painting, the artist preserves the rich colors and detailed focus of his predecessors, theilluminated manuscriptpainters, while attempting to create a coherent spatial world. The river winds into the background, yet the townscape in the distance is rendered with as much clarity as the trim on the Virgin's drapery.

This view of the north side of Saint Mark's Square features its celebrated clock tower, topped by bronze figures that strike the hours. Yet the church bells on the far right actually belong to a rooftop two buildings away. By moving the bells to the side of the drawing, Canaletto emphasized the receding perspective. He frequently distorted and rearranged monuments to suit his refined sense of composition.Canaletto probably enlisted the aid of a camera obscura, a ruler, and a compass to produce this sketch, reworking it later in his studio. He often referred to drawings for guidance and inspiration. He may also have used this sketch as a pattern for a larger painting from his workshop. Canaletto left many notes on the sketch, including one to remind himself of the drawing he made on the verso--a market scene of elegant gentlemen mingling with vendors among an array of merchandise.","15 9 16 x 10 7 8 in.","Terracotta","Spanish","Bust of Alexis-Jean-Eustache Taitbout","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11099801.jpg","Jean-Jacques Caffieri","96.SC.344"
"1765 - 1770","Canaletto specialized invedute, or views, of Venice that he sold to tourists on the Grand Tour in the 1700s. For a brief time in the 1740s, he painted scenes of contemporary life set around the principal monuments of ancient Rome, based either on drawings made during an earlier visit to Rome or on engravings by other artists. Both groups of his views appealed to the traveler as well as the antiquarian.Seen through the central bay of the Arch of Constantine is the Colosseum, which Canaletto shifted to the left in the interests of compositional design. Figures converse, stroll, or carry out daily chores in the vicinity of these ancient buildings. To the left, a lone man sits on ruins with his back to the viewer, perhaps sketching or writing. Wealthy tourists and their servants laden with goods contrast with the poor Roman natives who have nothing, such as the woman who lies against the Arch or the man with a cane at the right. In this painting, Canaletto seems to remark on the gulf between Rome's ancient glory and the city's current impoverished state.","9 x 13 7 16 in.","Marble","Italian","Hope Nourishes Love","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00134801.jpg","Jean-Jacques Caffieri","86.SA.703"

Although the strong horizontal line of the architecture forms the focus of the drawing as it divides earth from sky, Canaletto also filled the scene with many intricate details. A huntsman walks across the courtyard, dressed in a long frock coat and three-cornered hat, his rifle slung over one shoulder and his dog trotting beside him. A couple stand conversing against the back wall, while another woman in a full skirt and white apron enjoys the sunshine underneath the tower on the right. The rooftops of the city below can be glimpsed through the arched gateway of the central gate. These small details not only give a sense of the wall's great height but also humanize the scene.Canaletto probably made this drawing as a preparatory study for a subsequent painting of the same subject.

Nude except for sandals, his lyre hangs on the tree trunk that supports a piece of rumpled drapery. He stands incontrapposto,a balanced stance characterized by the opposition of straight and bent limbs, in a moment of reflection after the dramatic chase.Apollo'snudity, his broad, muscular chest, and his relaxed, balanced pose all recall famous antique representations of the god.

"1630 - 1640","Vestal Virgins, consecrated to Vesta, Roman goddess of the hearth, served in temples as guardians of an eternal, sacred flame and were expected to emulate the goddess's purity and chastity. In his representation of one of these women, sculptor Antonio Canova suggested her innocence through the austerity and sparseness of theNeoclassicalstyle, drawing on the contemporary idea thatclassicalforms carry with them the expression of a strict morality. Thebustis made of simple geometric shapes: a square for the bust and oval for the face. The tightly wound headcovering pulls in her hair and, with the cloak, draws attention to the purity of the shapes. Her firm shoulders and uninhibited, unmoving stare further suggest her resolve, innocence, and moral authority. Despite her physical beauty and the softness of the folds of the cloak, the statue does not invite touching. It is a cool, intellectual work of simple forms and restrained emotion.With the discovery of the so-called House of the Vestals inPompeii, Vestal Virgins became a popular subject in the 1700s and 1800s. This figure wears a historically accurate cloak, which suggests that Canova researched the subject.","12 1 2 x 8 1 2 in.","Terracotta","American","Storage Jar with an Episode from  The Seven against Thebes ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01778601.jpg","Caivano Painter","92.AE.86"

I took out my second Contax camera and began to shoot without raising my head. -- Robert CapaUnder heavy fire, photographer Robert Capa swam ashore along with American soldiers on D-Day in World War II, making images of their successful yet deadly attempt to establish a beachhead in France. While troops around him aimed their guns at enemy forces above the beach, Capa aimed his camera at them, capturing the soldiers' bravery and the battle's intensity. Because Capa was standing in the water with them, the camera angle provides a sense of the chaos of war that soldiers surely felt on that day.Although Capa shot 72 images that day, all but eleven were ruined when the negatives were placed in an overheated film drying cabinet in a London lab. The images that survived appear grainy and blurry, partly due to this error, and partly due to Capa's nerves. Despite the damage, the effect appears almost intentional--as a visual metaphor for the confusing experience of combat. As with many of his war photographs, this image exemplifies Capa's oft-quoted philosophy,  If your pictures aren't good enough, you aren't close enough.

"1865","Known in her younger days as the  sirenwith green eyes,  Madame Nadine Dumas retains her grace and charm in this portraitbustof her at a mature age. Carved in white marble, she is a handsome woman in her later years with a forceful presence. As she turns with a steady gaze, her upright pose conveys self-assurance. Her unconventional expression suggests intelligence and strength as it shows her with a furrowed brow, caught in a moment of thought. The lace edging on her blouse and the waves in her upswept hair add animation to the smooth surface, while the termination of the bust is softened with a shawl loosely knotted around the shoulders and waist.The daughter of a lawyer from the Baltic region, Nadine, born Nadeja Knorring, married Prince Alexandre Naryschkine, her elder by twenty years. After separating from her husband, she lived with the famous author Alexandre Dumasfilsfor about twelve years, unable to marry him until 1864, when Prince Naryschkine died. Artist Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, a close friend of Dumas and a witness at his wedding to Nadeja, conceived of the bust as a friendship portrait. He carved it while staying with the Dumas couple in the north of France near Dieppe.","15 15 16 x 12 1 8 in.","Albumen silver print","British","Prospero","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06512001.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XZ.186.32"

In Athenian aristocratic circles in the Archaic period, older men often courted youths. Such homosexual relationships were viewed as a key element in the socialization of youths, involving strong elements of mentoring as well as eroticism.The exterior of the cup depicts youths and bearded men training in various athletic activities, including the javelin, discus, and long jump. The youth in the long robe playing the flutes provides music for the training. Greek vases of the Archaic period frequently depict favorite pursuits of the aristocratic patrons who used the vessels; scenes of athletic training, another key element in the socialization of Athenian youths, are among the most common.","16 x 9 1 2 in.","Albumen print","Canadian","Prayer and Praise","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06517901.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XZ.186.91"

"1867","Although Saint Sebastian is usually depicted bound to a tree or pillar and pierced by arrows, that attempt by the Romans to take his life was unsuccessful. Ludovico Carracci chose to represent the moment after the subsequent deadly beating, when Roman soldiers dumped Sebastian's limp and lifeless body into a sewer.Against the dark of night, brutish soldiers lift and tug the dead saint's body. Ludovico contrasted the tensile strength of their straining bodies with the slackness of the saint's limbs, head, and facial muscles as he falls into the sewer's depths. The night atmosphere is dark and thick: figures seem to emerge from the blackness. Light glints dully off helmets and armor, but the soldiers' faces are unreadable. A bright light suffuses the body of Saint Sebastian, making him the focal point of the composition.In 1612 Cardinal Maffeo Barberini commissioned this painting from Ludovico for his family's chapel in the Church of San Andrea della Valle in Rome. The chapel commemorated the site where Saint Sebastian's body was recovered from the sewer, called the Cloaca Maxima. Barberini decided to keep the painting in his private collection, believing that an image of the recovery of Sebastian's body by Christians was more appropriate for the church.","10 7 8 x 8 1 8 in.","Albumensilver print","British","Magdalene (Brookfield)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06519001.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XZ.186.102"

In the figure on therecto, Carracci used white chalk to pick up highlights on the man's back and curly locks of hair.Carracci based this drawing on a painting by Veronese that he saw on a trip to Venice and Padua in 1582. During this sojourn, Carracci carefully studied the works of the Venetian masters Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese and made numerous engravings after their paintings.","9 3 4 x 9 5 16 in.","Albumen print","British","Beatrice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06536601.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XM.443.36"

The lamb is a gift to Christ and may symbolize his future sacrifice. Other offerings include a basket of eggs and small birds held by children: humble yet symbolic counterparts to the opulent gifts brought by the three kings.The upper right corner of the composition shows three unknown bearded men in profile, probably a study for a medal.

"1867","A nude triton displays his rippling, muscular figure as he turns to blow a conch shell announcing a special event. His powerful sculptural form and sense of monumentality derive from ancient Roman sculpture and Renaissance art, especially Michelangelo's Sistine Chapelignudi, while the use of black and white chalks on blue-gray paper reflects Agostino Carracci's interest in Venetian art of the 1500s.Agostino Carracci made this drawing as a study for a triton in his fresco,Thetis Borne to the Wedding Chamber of Peleus, also known asGalatea. The Carracci brothers began work on the decoration of the Galleria Farnese in Rome, including this fresco, in 1597. For centuries, this cycle of paintings influenced artists as much as Michelangelo's Sistine ceiling.Beginning with drawing from life and understanding anatomy, the Carracci focused on painting the human figure. Their drawings of the nude maintained monumental proportions while broadly sketching the body's essential structure; combining robust energy with soft, rhythmic contours.The fragment of an arm on the verso of this drawing was trimmed from a study of a triton now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, proving that this sheet was once part of a larger one.","12 3 16 x 10 1 4 in.","Albumensilver print","British","A Bacchante","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06537001.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XM.443.40"
"1868","The sad, staring eyes, prominent ears that sit a bit far back on the head, tousled hair, and the long flat nose identify this as Annibale Carracci. He assumed an informal pose, leaning slightly forward with his right elbow extending slightly beyond the frame's bottom and casting a shadow. As he drew himself in the mirror, his right hand was moving, resulting in the tangle of lines representing the left arm. Skeletal beasts with beaked heads and long necks peer down from the upper corners, reminders of mortality, and two beady-eyed dolphins with tails in the air inhabit the bottom corners.Carracci humorously portrayed himself here as a scruffy, ordinary individual. In a format usually reserved for formal, flattering portraits, he demonstrated his ability to quickly pick out the most important, expressive features. In a display of originality, he leans forward out of the picture frame as if from a window.Francesco Maria Niccol Gabburri, who assembled numerous drawn self-portraits and portraits of artists, once owned this sheet. He also owned the Getty Museum'sSelf-portraitby Gaetano Sabatini, which shares the oval format.

"1872","Kneeling on a rock with his head bowed, Christ pushes his hands forcefully against his chest in a sign of humility--an emotional display played up by Juan Carreo de Miranda's bold drawing style. Carreo made this preparatory drawing for his paintingThe Baptism of Christ, which shows John the Baptist anointing Jesus in the desert as God watches from above.To add solidity to the chest and limbs, Carreo used stumping, a technique of blending charcoal and chalk with a soft, stick like object. Thick, charcoal-black lines delineate rippling muscles and slightly enlarged limbs. White-chalk highlights create the illusion that parts of the body project forward in space, adding a sense of three-dimensionality. Red chalk on Christ's hands and feet creates further naturalistic details by suggesting flesh tones.Although Carreo's rough drawing style is distinctly Spanish, the combination of charcoal and red and white chalk reflects the strong influence of Renaissance Venetian art on seventeenth-century Spanish artists. Carreo studied the works of Titian, and often collaborated with other Spanish artists captivated by the Italian style, such as fellow court painter Francisco Rizi.","5 1 8 x 6 1 4 in.","Albumensilver print","British","Marie Spartali","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06521001.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XM.349.2"

Using simple broad monumental forms for the body, he expressed Dumas's artistic power as an almost physical force. In contrast to the large planes of the coat and limbs, the sculptor crisply defined the facial features and hair with a sharp tool. Since Dumas had died over thirteen years earlier, Carrier-Belleuse derived the facial features from an earlier marble portraitbust, made by another artist and exhibited in 1876.","13 7 8 x 19 3 16 in.","Albumensilver print","British","I Wait (Rachel Gurney)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06522801.jpg","Julia Margaret Cameron","84.XM.443.2"

A classically posed male figure, presumably the father, casually leans on his horse, looking toward his family. The lazy-looking dog to the left of the composition is a stock figure that appears in some of the artist's other drawings.

Castiglione  drew  with the brush in oils, using little color and thus conveying the effect of a drawing rather than a painting. He used white sparingly to highlight; most of the composition is sketched in thick, textural strokes of red-brown oil paint, enhancing the image's tone of dark, brooding emotion.

Casting a deep shadow over the right side of Jerome's body and the back of the niche, the hatching hints at the depth of the shallow space. Although by the mid-1600s this depiction was considered a little old-fashioned, artists in the Renaissance frequently showed the intellectual saint at work in his study.Juan del Castillo changed his mind about the composition in several minor areas. He altered the saint's cap to a cardinal's hat and reduced the drapery in the lower left, part of which originally fell outside the edge of the niche, so that it would fit within the design. Although he probably intended the design for a wall decoration, it also could have been used for a painting in an arched frame.Castillo may have drawn the figure study on the back swiftly from life or used a flayed cadaver to capture the lifeless droop of the man's body.","55 x 76 1 2 in.","Pen and brown ink over black chalk","Italian","The Campo San Basso: The North Side with the Church (Recto); A Market Scene (Verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13684501.jpg","Canaletto","2000.9"

According to Ripa,Amicitiawas to be shown as a fair young woman, simply draped in the white robe of Truth, the virtue upon which friendship is based. She goes barefoot  for friendship knows no inconvenience too great for it,  and rests one foot on a skull,  for friendship jeers at death.  The artist probably intended the sphere drawn here as a free allusion to the skull. The inscription cerca (close) and lexos (far) on her breast refers to Ripa's description of keeping friends close to one's heart, regardless of whether they are near or far.Castillo drew a study for a scene ofChrist on the Crosson the back of this drawing.

These ornamental vases were made in three sizes: a large central vase with handles in the shape of bearded male heads, a pair of smaller vases with heads of young women, and a pair of still smaller vases with heads of boys. In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles.

The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Svres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the rpareur, tienne-Henry Bono.

Colored marble such as this was quite expensive and a popular symbol of wealth in the Roman world. It was used primarily for architectural decoration and occasionally for sculpture.This sculpture, acquired by the Getty Museum as a Roman work and believed to have come from the ruins of the palace of the emperorDomitian, has been recently reexamined. These studies suggest that the sculpture was in fact made in the 1700s as a copy of a Roman statue. The centaur is covered with pointing marks that are not ancient.The Getty Museum centaur is remarkably similar to another centaur carved by the eighteenth-century sculptor Bartolomeo Cavaceppi, who offered copies of Romancentaursin his sales catalogue. The Getty centaur may also be the work of Cavaceppi.","23 5 8 x 19 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Omaha Beach, Normandy, France","www.getty.edu art collections images l 25679101.jpg","Robert Capa","2004.156.2"

In this marblebust, he wears a soldier's cuirass and toga. Turning his head to the left, he focuses on something that apparently does not meet with his approval. He flares his nostrils and furrows his brow, movements perhaps intended to suggest his ferociousness.In the 1700s, Caracalla's likeness was known from a bust in the Farnese collection in Rome and then Naples, believed to date from the 200s. Sculptor Bartolomeo Cavaceppi drew on this famous prototype for his marble bust of Caracalla. Carved during a period in which collectors bought sculpturesall' antica, this bust was probably intended for an English collector'sNeoclassicalgallery.Cavaceppi was best known for his restorations ofantiquesculpture rather than for his rare original works, such as this one. He demonstrated his familiarity withclassicismthrough his skillful drillwork in the antique manner, seen in the handling of Caracalla's beard and hair. This bust is one of Cavaceppi's rare signed works.","17 x 20 7 8 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, brown ground color, polychrome enamel decoration, gold foils, enamels in imitation of jewels, gilding","French","Cup and Saucer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00656701.jpg","Antoine Capelle","81.DE.28"

He leans towards Saul with an intense and penetrating gaze indicating troubled concern. Between the two figures, the Witch of Endor also leans forward to look fearfully at the kneeling king.Bernardo Cavallino depicted an episode from theBiblewhen King Saul, about to enter into battle with the Philistines, asked the Witch of Endor to summon the ghost of Samuel, who had recently died. In an irritable mood at having been summoned, Samuel told Saul that the next day the Philistines would defeat Israel and that Saul and his sons would die in battle. Cavallino was able to convey eloquently the emotional interaction among the three figures as Samuel relayed this news.Cavallino applied the paint with rapid, sketchy strokes, allowing the hammered copper's warm tones to glow through the thinly brushed paint in sections of the drapery andbackground.","25 3 4 x 32 1 8 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, dark brown(fond capelle)ground color, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","French","Plate","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00681601.jpg","Antoine Capelle","88.DE.2"

Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized him.  The artist heightens the scene's tension by positioning the table at the very front of the picture plane, hemming in the substantial figures.It is thought that Bartolomeo Cavarozzi painted this painting, which is after Caravaggio's innovative treatment of the subject, now in the National Gallery, London. During the 1600s, Caravaggio's original was in Rome, where it was seen and copied by many artists. The Getty Museum's picture follows the original closely, but with several important differences. The positioning of the three figures surrounding Christ has been reversed. These figures are also shown from a slightly lower viewpoint than Caravaggio's, making them more monumental. This painting has less spatial depth and a more symmetrical composition than Caravaggio's original. The artist also enlarged and lavished great attention on the still life capturing the play of light across a range of textures and surfaces.","18 15 16 x 24 7 8 in.","Black chalk and brown wash, heightened with white gouache, squared in black chalk","France","Saint Jerome Hearing the Trumpet of the Last Judgement","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00046901.jpg","Vicente Carducho","94.GA.86"

Instead, he limited the figure's goat-like features to the face, which displays protruding horns and a savage, animal-like expression that Cellini described as  fiery and menacing, instilling fear into the beholders.  Cellini designed this and a similar figure to flank the monumental entrance of Porte Dore, the royal palace atFontainebleau. Turning his head sharply to his left, the bearded and horned satyr gazes fiercely--with a dramatically furrowed brow; deeply chiseled eyes; full, gnarled lips; and an open-mouthed scowl--toward an unknown intruder. Cellini posed the figure with the right arm raised to support a cornice. In the left hand, a short stump suggests the thick club the figure was designed to lean on, which was evidently broken before the model was cast.  The French KingFranois Icommissioned Cellini to execute the designs for Porte Dore in the early 1540s; however, after being accused of theft in 1545 Cellini was forced to leave France. Consequently, the project was never completed. Scholars believe that in his haste, Cellini left the wax models for his design behind, and they were later cast by an unknown artist.","5 9 16 x 4 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","French","The Bucintoro Departing from the Bacino di San Marco","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00091701.jpg","Luca Carlevarijs","86.PA.600"

With the Christ child on her lap, Mary is approached by young Saint John the Baptist and his mother, the Virgin's cousin Saint Elizabeth. The elderly Elizabeth helps her son along as he walks toward Jesus to offer him a globe, a sign of Christ's role as savior of the world. Two small boys, possibly angels, accompany the group. At the center of the relief, a prominently placed tree likely signifies the Tree of Life.The relief may have formed part of a larger sculptural complex, although it would also have been appropriate for an altar.

"470 - 460","When a jury member at the ParisSalonof 1866 first saw Paul Czanne's portrait of the journalist and critic Antony Valabrgue, he exclaimed that the portrait was not painted with a knife but with a pistol. Although the Salon refused him admission, Czanne continued to paint many portraits of his friend, including the present example, thought to have been painted around 1869 to 1871.For this painting, Czanne used a palette knife rather than brushes. With the spatula-like instrument, he applied paint in thick, successive layers, giving the surface a complex, rough-and-smooth texture. He then used the knife to squeeze the paints together so that they mixed directly on the canvas. In this fashion Czanne moved the paint around, eliminating contour lines and instead creating impastoed areas of color, as if sculpting in paint. In another portrait of his friend made four years earlier, the coarse, almost violent appearance created by Czanne's technique led Valabrgue to complain in a letter to the writer Zola:  He has given me such a fierce complexion that it reminds me of the statue of Champfleury when it was stained with squashed blackberries.

"1570s","The nude played a central role in Paul Czanne's art throughout his career, but, paradoxically for an artist who usually drew from life, he seldom used nude models in his working process: he was said to be ill-at-ease with naked sitters.  I paint still lifes,  he once told Renoir,  Women models frighten me.  Cezanne contented instead with studying earlier artists and using the drawings after nude models that he had made in art school in Paris.The meaning of this enigmatic painting is unclear, and it has been known by several titles. This woman is confronted by devotees from different arts and occupations, among them a miteredbishop, whose admiration seems intrusive, even aggressive. A painter sometimes identified as Eugne Delacroix stands at his easel painting the scene. The bald figure at the painting's bottom may be Czanne himself. Whether she encourages their adoration, passively accepts it, or is trapped by her cult is unclear. Like many of Czanne's nudes, the woman's face is nearly blank, except for her red eye sockets.

"1493","During the last thirty years of his life, Paul Czanne painted the same objects--the green vase, the rum bottle, the ginger pot, and the apples--over and over again. His interest was not in the objects themselves but in using them to experiment with shape, color, and lighting. He arranged his still lifes so that everything locked together. Edges of objects run into each other; for example, a black arabesque seemingly escapes from the blue cloth to capture an apple in the center; the sinuous curves of the blue ginger pot's rattan straps merge with other straps on the body of the bottle behind. Giving form and mass to objects through the juxtaposition of brushstrokes and carefully balanced colors and textures, he gave the painting a sense of comforting stability.","7 3 16 x 6 7 16 in.","Terracotta","Italian","Vessel with a Girl Riding Piggyback on a Satyr","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00798401.jpg","Carlsruhe Painter","71.AE.444"

Since theRenaissance, artists have used this pose to portray melancholy. The pose, combined with her hauntingly unreadable face, gives a human poignancy and psychological tension to the figure.Juxtaposing bold, individual strokes of color, Paul Czanne built up the woman's powerful physical presence and the space she occupies. As a twentieth-century painter and admirer of Czanne observed, his later works, such asYoung Italian Womanhave  an enormous sense of volume, breathing, pulsating, expanding, contracting, through his use of colors.  While the woman's form is convincing, the space behind and around her can appear contradictory and even confusing. How far away is the wall  Is the tabletop flat underneath the cloth  Does she sit or stand  These questions give tension and movement to an otherwise stablecomposition.From the 1890s until the end of his life, Czanne painted a number of these grand figure studies, usually relying upon local workers or residents for his models.","Diam.:  16 15 16 x D:  5 in.","Oil on panel","French","Dionysius the Areopagite Converting the Pagan Philosophers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00088001.jpg","Antoine Caron","85.PB.117"
"1490 - 1495","The still life was a principal theme throughout Paul Czanne's artistic career. Using a repertoire of everyday objects such as fruit, jugs, bottles, and plates, he experimented with relationships of form, color, and pattern. Although the groupings seem casual, Czanne is known to have taken great care with the arrangement, sometimes spending hours positioning the objects.In this brightly colored watercolor, Czanne's monumental conception of form is evident: the jug, the two pots, one white, one blue, and the seven apples assume a physical presence beyond normal perception of their existence. Using small patches of color laid next to one another, Czanne evoked the plasticity of substance, building form rather like bricks build structures. His fresh and vigorous brushstrokes are visible against the background wall as areas of greens and blues are juxtaposed. The apples are described with red arcs around the perimeter, then yellow brushstrokes next to the red; the empty middle suggests light reflecting off the surface. Curving brushstrokes of brown, green, and blue that seem to blend with the bottom half of the wall actually compose the tablecloth.","8 x 5 1 2 in.","Brush and brown wash and black chalk, heightened with white bodycolor, on faded blue paper","French","Bishop Holding a Candle (recto); Draped Legs (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00025301.jpg","Vittore Carpaccio","88.GG.89"

Chardin built up the forms with a series of rapid, somewhat heavy, black lines, heightened with additional strokes of white chalk that give a sense of immediacy and vibrancy to the otherwise static image. With a few bold strokes, he established a mood of quiet contemplation generated by his own direct observation and that of the seated man, who gazes off into the distance. Chardin made this figure study in preparation for a painting.On the verso, Chardin drew anacadmie,a study of a nude man, probably made during his early artistic training.

In still lifes, genre scenes, and the occasional portrait, Chardin's skill at rendering the visual and tactile qualities of simple objects won him the admiration of critics like Diderot.In this small still life, Chardin portrayed a modest subject--three walnuts, four peaches, two bunches of grapes, and a pewter mug--but gave the objects monumentality by arranging them in pure geometric groupings and concentrating on their basic forms. He suggested the objects' various textures and substances through the play of light across surfaces and successive applications of paint. In this way, Chardin conveyed the fuzzy skin of the peaches, the hard, brittle shell of the walnuts, the translucence of the grapes, and the heavy, cold exterior of the pewter mug.","12 3 4 x 23 x 21 in.","Black and white chalk on light blue paper (recto); black chalk (verso)","Spanish","Cupid Overpowering Pan (recto); Head of a Monk; Caricature of a Man in Profile (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00043501.jpg","Agostino Carracci","95.GB.49"

The population of Madagascar was made up of the ruling Hova tribe and the native Madegasse, to which group the women pictured here belonged. The three women and the girl stand in the center of the frame, presenting themselves to the camera in silent formality. Charnay was an enthusiastic imperialist who rather patronizingly described the Madegasse as  of a gentle and timid disposition, faithful and devoted.  He was successful in getting them to pose, representing the island's colonized population in their finery of French printed cotton.","8 1 2 x 6 15 16 in.","Black and white chalk on blue paper (recto); black chalk (verso)","French","Study of Triton Blowing a Conch Shell (recto); Partial Study of an Arm (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00007401.jpg","Agostino Carracci","84.GB.48"

He used delicate, almost imperceptible lines to create the sitter's face and hands. Soft shading shapes the boy's round cheek, squashed up under his eye as he rests his head on his hand. In contrast, Chassriau drew the boy's clothing with dark, strong lines, clearly emphasizing the precise, elegant hatching that creates the fabric's shadows and folds.","61 1 8 in.","Pen and brown ink","Italian","Self-Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10866701.jpg","Annibale Carracci","96.GA.323"
"1682","The severed head ofSaint John the Baptist, executed at the request ofSalome, King Herod's stepdaughter, rests on a charger. According to theBible, Salome's request was prompted by her mother, Herodias, who wanted revenge on theprophetwho had condemned her incestuous marriage toHerod. In later interpretations of the story, Herod and Herodias become symbols of lust and surfeit, and the charger, passed around the table with John's head, becomes a precedent for the ceremony of the Eucharist. The story was particularly popular in the Middle Ages, when images of Saint John's head on a charger were believed to have therapeutic and curative powers. This bronzereliefby Jean-Baptiste Chatigny plays down the gruesome aspects of the story, emphasizing John's surrender instead of the decapitation. Chatigny smoothly cut the neck, blending it into the round edge of the plate while focusing more attention on the upper areas of the face. The loose modeling and imprecise treatment of the surfaces towards the top of the relief, especially apparent in the hair, augment the image's surreal qualities. John's closed eyes and open mouth make him seem all-too-human, emphasizing the pathos and tragedy of his death.","56 1 2 in.","Black chalk (recto); black and red chalk (verso)","Italian","Four Studies of Heads Drawn over a Copy of Saint John the Evangelist by Correggio (recto); Three Studies of Men (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00012501.jpg","Annibale Carracci","85.GB.218"
"1883","This study of a woman in a loosely fitted dress posed against a studio easel demonstrates one of the earliest uses for which photography was considered appropriate, as a tool for painters and graphic artists. Shortly after photography's emergence in the mid-1800s, a great debate arose over whether or not this technological medium should be regarded as an art form. Many artists argued that photographs could not be considered art because they were made with a mechanical device and chemicals rather than by human hand and spirit. These individuals did however see photography as a useful way to eliminate the drudgery of studying from a live model. Figures posed in studio settings soon became a popular subject. Female figures, as a study in beauty and as a symbol of motherhood, were of great interest to all types of artists during this period.","2 11 16 x 2 1 4 in.","Pen and brown ink and gray-brown wash, heightened with whitebodycolor, over touches of black chalk on light brown paper","French","The Visitation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00047401.jpg","Juan Carreo de Miranda","94.GA.91"

The Svres porcelain manufactory sold these vases for the high sum of three hundred and sixtylivres--an amount equivalent to six months' salary for a porcelain painter.Svres artisans made the vases from  true,  hard-paste porcelain, instead of the traditional soft-paste. The hard-paste porcelain recipe was still new, and the craftsmen were still experimenting with different types of decoration when these pieces were produced in 1778. Instead of glazing the vases with ground color and then gilding them, porcelain gilders first applied the gold onto the white body of the vases. Porcelain painters then added enamel colors within the gold outlines. Decorators also experimented with the use of silver on thetrellisworkas seen on these vases, but they soon abandoned this practice since the silver tarnished over time.","excluding base","Charcoal, red and white chalk, with stumping","French","Christ Baptized","www.getty.edu art collections images l 24416801.jpg","Juan Carreo de Miranda","2003.24"

This richly illuminated private prayer book includes a calendar of church holidays and texts for devotional services inspired by the eight daily services of the divine office. The rise in literacy among the merchant and noble classes and their desire to express a newly emotional personal piety, particularly in veneration of the Virgin Mary, spurred the popularity of books of hours in the 1400s. In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.","13 1 2 x 24 in.","Pastel on blue paper","Italian","Sir James Gray, Second Baronet","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31444901.jpg","Rosalba Carriera","2009.80"

Sculptor Joseph Chinard paid great attention to stylish details such as elegant furniture and the woman's hairstyle and dress. Although he included such popular artistic conventions as a revealed breast, he also expressed her deep longing through her gentle manner and intense look. To make this love theme explicit, the artist used symbolic props such as the putti on the sides of the bed. The putto on the right represents earthly sensual love, while the one on the left, with his eyes bound shut, represents heavenly spiritual love. Together they hold the rope that symbolically binds the family together.Chinard created this keepsake for the French Duhesme family, using a format traditionally reserved for tombs, where the medallion identifies the deceased. Since the figure represented in the medallion, General Philippe Guillaume Duhesme, was still living when this sculpture was made, the medallion signifies absence rather than death.","2 7 8 x 6 11 16 in.","Red chalk, pen and brown ink, brownwash, and white bodycolorheighteningon light brown paper","Spanish","The Agony in the Garden","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00040601.jpg","Valerio Castello","92.GB.78"

The battle of Herakles and Triton first appeared in Greek art about 565 B.C. and was especially popular in the period from about 530 to 510 B.C. No ancient author recorded the story of Herakles and Triton. This lack of literary sources for the depiction and the fact that it appears almost exclusively in Athenian art has led some scholars to look for a special meaning in the scene. The mythological battle may have had symbolic political significance for the Athenians. The tyrants who ruled Athens in this period, Peisistratos and his sons, may have adopted Herakles as their symbol; and the scene may refer to a naval victory of Athens over her neighboring enemy, the city-state of Megara.","2 3 4 x 6 11 16 in.","Red-brown, blue-green, and white oil paint and brush on tan paper","Spanish","The Expulsion of Hagar","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00005201.jpg","Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione","83.GG.376"

Increasingly, Closson and his contemporaries of the early 1800s were painting landscapes outdoors, using not only watercolor but oil on paper. By immediately rendering his observations in paint, Closson developed his skill at reproducing nature's myriad, constantly shifting colors. He used the oil paint's thickness and saturated, opaque colors to invest the simple leaves with a powerful visual impact.The butterburr, also known as bog rhubarb, has enormous leaves, which Closson showed in varying phases, from verdant green to withered purplish-brown. At the center, a leaf is beginning to change color, midway between life and death. Closson's choice of a close viewpoint and monumental treatment of what might otherwise seem a trivial subject lead the viewer to contemplate the cyclical nature of life.

In the 1500s, this popular parable taught about the sin of extravagance and the virtue of forgiveness. In contrast to the text of the Bible, which emphasizes the father's final act of forgiveness, artists and patrons of that period often focused lively attention on the brothel scene. Coecke set it further forward than the rest of the action, with the detailed landscape and architectural passages of the other episodes forming an elaborate backdrop.

She asks him why he is despondent, saying,  you are wrong if you think thatFortunehas changed towards you. Change is her normal behavior.  On the right, Fortune, a beautiful woman, spins her wheel, which represents the changes she brings about in men's lives. A king sits on top of the wheel, but a simple turn of the wheel can bring him down in station while it raises the fortunes of another. Philosophy demonstrates that Fortune rules the world and that the wise person ignores her ever-shifting ways, preferring eternal truths.","8 5 8 x 6 15 16 in.","Tempera on panel","French","Polyptych with Coronation of the Virgin and Saints","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00064601.jpg","Cenni di Francesco di Ser Cenni","83.GB.269"

"1869 - 1871","After 1850, France's railroads expanded rapidly under private ownership and with the encouragement ofNapoleon III. Both the government and private owners of railroads commissioned photographs to attract new investors to the transportation system; theChemin de Fer du Bourbonnais(Bourbonnais Railway Company) assigned Hippolyte-Auguste Collard to make this photograph, an interior view of a roundhouse, a building for servicing and housing locomotives. Roundhouses were less efficient than rectangular buildings because of their single rotating center slab that moved the locomotives into their berths. But that fact would never be deduced from this gleaming, orderly interior, a model of efficiency.Each identical engine aligns perfectly with the hood that draws the steam from the pipe, thus keeping the building clear of poisonous carbon monoxide fumes. Using awide-angle lens, Collard has photographed the scene to maximize the room's spatial configuration, and in doing so he has flattened theperspective. The engines appear to be miniatures: only the door visible at the lower center edge between two engines gives an indication of the interior's actual scale and the technical feat that Collard achieved in rendering such a sweeping view.","11 1 4 x 9 1 16 in.","Pen and brown ink over red chalk","French","The Swooning Virgin Supported by Three Holy Women and Three Studies of Men (recto); Saint George and the Dragon (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00015401.jpg","Cesare da Sesto","98.GB.1"
"1877","In the 1800s new railroads demanded a new kind of building: the railroad station. Gare de Nevers, a modest station in a provincial area, exemplifies the glass-and-iron building type that French architects and engineers developed in response to this need. Combining a train shed and a passenger building, the railroad station had to provide an area wide enough to accommodate parallel tracks and tall enough to diffuse smoke and steam from the train's engine. This station's shed is so large that the engine waiting beneath it looks miniature. Beside the shed, doors lead to the passenger building, where people could purchase tickets, dispose of luggage, await departure or arrival, and generally make the jolting transition between the familiar urban world and the realm of steam and speed.","7 7 8 x 6 1 16 in.","Black chalk","French","Holy Family with Saint John the Baptist Adored by an Unidentified Figure","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11323901.jpg","Bartolomeo Cesi","85.PA.45"

Although the absolute symmetry of the bridge and light posts is compelling and might have attracted another photographer, Hippolyte-Auguste Collard made a less obvious choice, positioning his camera at the end of the Point du Jour, slightly off-center and toward the middle of the right pedestrian arcade. This view establishes an unobstructed line of sight to a point in the far distance, making the viaduct seem infinite. The shadowy sweep of the bridge overhead fans out of the frame like a lopsided crown, while a puddle of water just in front of the left pedestrian passageway, whose arch bears the stains of seeping water, suggests a more mundane problem threatening the impressive structure.","8 x 8 1 8 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Portrait of Anthony Valabrgue","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00087701.jpg","Paul Czanne","87.PA.79"
"1895 - 1900","The railroad necessitated a straight and even path, which often involved cutting through the landscape, building embankments, and constructing viaducts. Hippolyte-August Collard's photographs of the Bourbonnais Railway in France show the stages of constructing a bridge, its use as a roadway, and finally its completed sculptural form. Two paddleboats appear in the image on the left, manned by gentlemen who were evidently indifferent to the raucous construction. In the central photograph, a train halts along the newly completed bridge, while numerous individuals pose atop its freight cars. Finally, in the last image, the bridge stands alone, having taken its position as the landscape's defining feature.Collard made the initial photograph showing construction in the summer of 1865. He returned to the site along the Loing in December 1866 to make the two subsequent images, positioning his camera in nearly the same location for each document.","25 3 4 x 32 in.","Oil on canvas","French","The Eternal Feminine","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00093101.jpg","Paul Czanne","96.PA.8"

"1848 - 1849","An unknown artist created this haunting scene filled with a maze of paths and aged, gnarled trees casting looming shadows. By using black paper and showing the forest at night, he accentuated nature's drama. Moonlight glints off twisted roots and leaves, piercing into the groves in the distance, partially illuminating but never fully revealing what is taking place. Humans appear only in the background, framed by the twisted tree trunks: two tiny figures making their way to the moated fortress at the left. The drawing's large scale and the artist's use of grisaille make it rare among the relatively common Dutch and Flemish drawings rendered in colored wash around 1600. At this time, some artists began to depict the forest as a place of mystery. Gillis van Coninxloo and his followers, known for their close-up views of nature, were among this group.","13 3 8 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Young Italian Woman at a Table","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13609401.jpg","Paul Czanne","83.GC.221"

Console tables were generally intended for a specific place, as they were considered part of the interior architecture. Architects often designed them, usually specifying carved decoration that matched the wall paneling and mirror frames.The carved shells, leafy scrolls, and basket of flowers on this console are all similar to a pair of tables created for the Danish ambassador to the court of Louis XV. Baron de Bernstorff, an ardent Francophile, ordered the architect Pierre Contant d'Ivry to produce designs for the furniture and interiors of his house in Copenhagen. Among the works produced were a pair of console tables that are similar both in their overall design and in their carved details to the Getty Museum's piece.","62.3 x 46 cm","Soft-paste porcelain, stippled turquoise(bleu cleste pointill)ground color, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","French","Cup and Saucer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00654401.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","87.PA.3"

"1755","On one side of this sheet, the recto, Michel Corneille the Younger described the faces and bodies of the Madonna and Child and additional heads, possibly Saint Joseph and the infant Saint John the Baptist, in red chalk. Red chalk had long been popular for drawing the human figure and for rendering pinkish-tan flesh tones because of its rosy color. By liberally laying in white chalk, Corneille created a sensuous play of light over the Christ Child's skin and described the diaphanous fabric loosely draped around the fleshy infant's body. To further heighten the brilliance of the red and white chalks, he chose blue paper as his support. The combination of red, white, and black chalk is a technique known by French term coined in the 1700s,aux trois crayons.On the verso, Corneille drew theMadonna and Child with Saint John Seated in a Landscapein pen and ink, suggesting tonal areas with brownwashand black chalk. The copying of figures from the recto and the more complete nature of the composition suggest that the verso drawing was made after the recto. The interior framing lines and the precise outlined figures suggest that this drawing was made in preparation for an engraving.","15 15 16 x 22 7 8 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, polychrome enamel decoration","French","Chamber Pot","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00658401.jpg","Chantilly Porcelain Manufactory","85.DI.380"

Christ faces the viewer and parts his lips as if to speak.Through the use of strong light and shadow as seen in the defined cheekbones, line of the nose, and hollow of the neck, Correggio gave his forms a sense of volume.

Over time, these monks, also known as  desert fathers,  organized into communities.Costa's scratchy, energetic draftmanship created a bustling composition filled with monks and a landscape riddled with the grottoes, huts, and caves they used for prayer and shelter. He portrayed an imaginary scene, incorporating a variety of monastic saints and spanning different periods. In the upper left background, Saints Paul and Anthony are shown seated, receiving bread from a raven through which God provided nourishment.

Courbet contributed a sense of psychological complexity to the drawing by depicting her in dark shadows.This richly toned drawing illustrates Courbet's disdain for the clean lines prescribed by the French Academy. He preferred to use thick deposits of cont crayon, vigorously smudged, to create texture and convey mood. This monumental life-sized drawing, like many of his paintings, was meant to create a jolting visual impact. Although Courbet included his formal signature in the lower right corner of the drawing, he also prominently placed his characteristic lower-casegon the young woman's neck, below her tendrils.","H:  2 ft. 11 1 2 in. x W:  4 ft. 5 3 4 in. x D:  2 ft. 1 1 2 in.","Marble","Italian","Allegorical Portrait of the van Risamburgh Family","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00145601.jpg","Joseph Chinard","85.SC.82"
"520 - 510"," To paint human beings, and paint them well--that's the really difficult thing,  said Gustave Courbet. His corpulent women shocked his critics, who were accustomed to less earthy depictions of the female form.Though Courbet painted many female nudes, only two of his drawings of this subject survive. For thiscomposition, Courbet modified the traditional academic nude study, theacadmie,into a more ordinary, less classically refined figure. He depicted a modern woman, but herclassicalpose and his sensitive modulation of form and careful rendering of flesh tones recall his study of theOld Mastersin theMuse du Louvre.Courbet made this drawing for a friend who remains unidentified. His inscription--Mon Vieux, C'en est une qu'on enverra  Sainte Beuve s'il nous embte! Gustave Ct. 28 Avril 49(Old man, here's one to send Sainte Beuve if he gives us a hard time!)--refers to literary historian and critic Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve, who was known for his conservative opinions.

"1984 - 1985","Gustave Courbet, who had previously painted less than a handful of flower pictures, took up the genre enthusiastically during a stay in western France in 1862. Intending to visit his friend Etienne Baudry for two weeks, he arrived at the garden enthusiast's chteau in May and remained in the area for eleven months. With his friend's encouragement, Courbet explored flower painting using Baudry's extensive gardens, greenhouses, and library of botanical books. He painted about twenty flower pictures and remarked to a friend,  I am coining money out of flowers. Courbet had visited Holland in 1847 and his exposure there to Dutch flower painting is evident. His arrangement shares the exuberant spontaneity and abundance of Dutch artist Jan Van Huysum'sVase of Flowers.Like his Netherlandish forebears, Courbet chose flowers that bloom at different times of the year: lilies, roses, gladioli, stock, asters, ipomoeas, poppies, and others. While he typically eschewedallegory, Courbet may have also followed the Dutch practice of using ephemeral flowers to suggest the transitory nature of life and human happiness. Unlike Van Huysum and other Dutch painters known for their intricately detailed technique, Courbet used broad brushstrokes and often spread his thick paint with apaletteknife.","50 1 4 x 18 1 2 x 8 in.","Terracotta","Italian","Bust of Madame Recamier","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00139701.jpg","Joseph Chinard","96.AE.59"
"1994","To create a living art, that is my aim.--Gustave CourbetThrough a dynamiccompositionand radical painting technique, Gustave Courbet emphasized the specific qualities of this primordial cave in his native region of the Jura Mountains in eastern France. Earthy hues and textures swirl around a tunnel-like entrance, drawing attention to the clear blue stream running through it. Two large boulders stand before the vortex, several feet from a wall hugged by delicate scaffolding. To mimic the cavern's craggy and colorful surfaces, Courbet usedpaletteknives to apply and scrape off paint and brushes to mix drying paint in with wet.Like many tourists and scientists of his day, Courbet was probably drawn to thegrottofor its geological interest. In the mid-1860s, he frequently painted caves as a means to explore composition and technique freely, and to demonstrate his strong belief that artistic subjects should be rooted in one's lived experience. He saw the basis ofRealismas  the denial of the ideal,  the rejection of establishedclassicalsubjects and a refined style. He chose instead, to paint only what he could see.","6 5 16 x 6 5 16 in.","Terracotta","French and British","Pitcher with Herakles Wrestling Triton","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10980301.jpg","Chiusi Painter","99.SE.66"

He stands against a portfolio containing colored paper; underneath, a silver holder contains sharpened pieces of chalk, the medium essential to his profession. Written on the portfolio is a dedication:  Charles Coypel has painted himself for Philippe Coypel, his brother and his best friend, 1734.  Coypel's younger brother was avalet de chambreto KingLouis XV, so the picture served also as a tool for self-promotion. Displayed in the Philippe's house, the self-portrait would have boldly presented the confident image of Charles to the powerful members of the king's inner circle.A brilliant portraitist, Coypel excelled in the medium ofpastel. He first drew a detailed underdrawing lightly in pencil, then made crisp outlines using a sharpened pastel crayon.

Although the central scenes showing the escapades of Don Quixote and his companion Sancho remained the same, the surrounding decoration, known as thealentours,changed to reflect current fashions. The Getty Museum's tapestries come from the eighth weaving, which used the newly invented rose- and crimson-colored ground.The French kings often gave tapestries as diplomatic gifts. On August 20, 1786,Louis XVIpresented the Museum's tapestries to his sister-in-law, the duchess of Saxe-Teschen, and her husband the duke, the governors of the Austrian Netherlands (modern Belgium). Unlike many surviving hangings from the 1700s, these four tapestries remain in superb condition. The colors of all four scenes have faded very little overall, and some colors are still strong, particularly the shades of purple in thealentours,which usually fade to gray upon exposure to light.The surrounds for these tapestries were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Franois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques.

"1460 - 1470","Lucas Cranach the Elder drew from both native German andclassicalliterary sources to depict a family offaunsin a woodland clearing. Although the precise subject of this painting remains obscure, it recalls the legendary  wild man  found in medieval mythology, as well as idyllic forest dwellers, such as fauns, described in Greek poetry.The male faun sits on a rock, staff in hand, with a slain lion at his feet. He gazes toward a woman--presumably his wife--and their children. Dark foliage mediates between them and a stunning landscape: a lake, a village, mountains, and a castle in the distance. Isolated and protected from civilization, these figures represent the wild traits of mankind. On the other hand, the faun's humanlike appearance, the woman's calm demeanor, and the baby's tender gesture suggest more civilized aspects of society.Aside from this broadernarrative, Cranach's finely worked style draws attention to incidental elements, such as the lion's fur and a man and a horse and cart climbing the castle-topped mountain. The lion's stylized body fits perfectly in the painting's lower left corner. Such attention to detail and Cranach's complex subject matter appealed to the refined tastes of his learned, courtlypatrons.","9 5 16 x 8 1 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and gray wash, over traces of black chalk","French","Scenes from the Life of the Prodigal Son","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00030301.jpg","Pieter Coecke van Aelst","MS. 42"
"1460 - 1470","For this unidentified sitter's likeness, one of Lucas Cranach the Elder's many portraits, Cranach used a technique uncommon in Northern European drawing of the early 1500s: brush and oil paint on paper. The gleaming white highlights of the oil paint in the face contrast with the brown ground, making the sitter seem to emerge from the shadows and enhancing the illusion of his living presence; the young man's large, intelligent eyes further the effect. Cranach combined intensity of expression with jewel-like refinement of surfaces to create a memorable image.To produce the brownish ground, Cranach rubbed the paper with oil. He then sketched in the outlines of the head in pen and ink, meticulously going over the eyebrows, lashes, and outer facial contours. Next, using black chalk and brown oil paint, he sketched in the hat and collar. He continued by working up the face in oil paint, meticulously establishing the nuanced contours of the man's facial structure.","H:  4 1 4 x W:  11 3 4 x D:  7 3 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","French","Miniatures from Consolation of Philosophy","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00178801.jpg","Cotivy Master","MS. 42, LEAF 1V"

His practice of casting bronze in his workshop broke strict guild rules; through the eighteenth century, the craft of casting and gilding bronze was restricted to a separate guild. Cressent was fined several times for these infringements; in order to pay the penalties, he was forced to hold sales of his stock. In a catalogue he wrote in 1756 for one such sale, he describes this commode's unique central gilt-bronze mount:  the bronzes [represent] two children who are grating snuff; in the middle is a monkey powdering itself with snuff. By the time it was built, this commode already looked old-fashioned. By the 1740s most commodes were constructed without a central divider that separated the two drawers. Although the curving gilt-bronze branches on the front try to mask this division, Cressent had to split the mount into three pieces--an awkward solution. He seems to have had difficulty selling the commode as it was still in his possession nearly twenty years after its construction.","51 x 39 3 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Line from Villeneuve-Saint-Georges to Montargis, Viaduct on the Loing","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14458301.jpg","Hippolyte-Auguste Collard","78.PA.232"

"1865","This wall clock design with an ornate gilt bronze case and bracket was popular in France; artisans produced such examples for nearly twenty years through the 1740s and 1750s. In the corner of the Getty Museum's pastel painting by Maurice-Quentin de la Tour from around 1740 sits a similar model in the form of a clock, on top of a cabinet. The Getty Museum's example can be dated to about 1758 because one of the movement's springs is inscribed with this date.Scholars believe that Charles Cressent, one of the greatestbnistesof the 1700s, designed the elaborate gilt bronze and enameled metal case of this clock. Stringent guild regulations prohibited Cressent from gilding and chasing this design himself as he was a cabinetmaker and not a member of the bronze caster's guild. However, by veneering the wooden sides of this clock with metal and then attaching the gilt bronze mounts on top, he could successfully avoid prosecution.","4 11 16 x 4 5 8 in.","Brush and gray and white bodycolor on toned black paper","French","Forest Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00020501.jpg","Gillis van Coninxloo","84.XT.266.13"
"1750 - 1755","Seeming to emerge from the background and float in front of it, the Trinity shown in this illumination has an assertive presence. Crivelli created a visually dynamic painting by contrasting the manner of representation in the main figural group with that of the background. In contrast to the sculptural clarity of the Trinity, the golden angels' heads in the background are painted in such a manner that they are partially formed out of the expanse of blue and red space, making them spatially ambiguous and ethereal. The Trinity represents the unity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead according to Catholic belief. The Trinity is shown here as God the Father holding the Crucified Christ with the dove representing the Holy Spirit between the two. This initial probably comes from a choir book that contained the sung portions of the Mass, where it introduced a text used on Trinity Sunday.","12 5 16 x 17 1 2 in.","Daguerreotype","French","Self-Portrait with a Recent Invention","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06420901.jpg","William Constable","84.XM.366.10"

The saint, a twelfth-century bishop of Padua, clasps the outstretched arms of Andrea Gualengo while also gesturing toward heaven. Saints were believed to act as intermediaries between God and the faithful. Here Bellinus, long dead, appears before those who pray to him, bridging the gap between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries and between this world and the next.The patrons of this manuscript appear with two sons, probably from one of Orsina's previous marriages. Orsina was a member of the ruling Este family in Ferrara, and Andrea Gualengo came from a family of high-ranking advisors at the Este court and held important ambassadorial posts. Andrea and Orsina are attired in the richly decorated robes, tunics, capes, and gowns characteristic of Italian Renaissance courts.

Given a papal dispensation that allowed their pigs to roam freely in medieval towns, the order took on the animal as itsemblem. Alone in his cave, the saint holds his prayer beads. This, along with his ecstatic facial expression, suggests that he is in the midst of fervent prayer. As in the other miniatures of the saints in thisbook of hours, Saint Anthony serves as a devotional model for themanuscript'sreaders, who are stimulated toward pious meditation as they read the prayer to him on the facing page.Crivelli set Anthony's peaked cave in a fantastic landscape that bears little resemblance to northern Africa, but the leafless trees and the barren ground do suggest a bleak wilderness.

"1770 - 1773","Aelbert Cuyp was mesmerized by Holland's flatness. Using a long, narrow sheet of paper, he expressed vastness in breadth by compressing the landscape into thin strata that continue off the sides of the page.

The simple, dramatic composition and statuesque main figures give this small, slightly eerie, moonlit scene a monumental quality. Yet the rhythm from the flowing movement and patterns of the garments enlivens the rocky desert setting and prevents the composition from being purely static.Richard Dadd's lightenedpalette, fascination with detail, and interest in decorative patterning typify mid-1800s English painting. For authenticity, Dadd selectedmotifsfrom Egyptian wallreliefs, Roman sculpture, his own memories, and possibly his own travel sketches of the desert and cliffs near the Dead Sea.To show this Old Testament subject, rarely seen in Victorian painting, Dadd mixed historical events, modern passions, and perhaps personal associations. After delusions led him to kill his father in 1843, he continued making art while confined to a mental hospital. Thinking that Dadd might cultivate David's moral virtues as an antidote to his own murderous compulsions, his doctor may even have suggested this subject.","3 3 16 x 3 1 16 in.","Silk and wool","German","Tapestry: Sancho's Entry on the Isle of Barataria, from The Story of Don Quixote Series","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00660901.jpg","Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory","82.DD.69"
"1769","Probably intended for a small chapel, this triptych shows the Virgin Mary in the center flanked by Saint Thomas Aquinas and Saint Paul. On the left panel Saint Thomas Aquinas wears the Dominican habit and holds a book of his writings. On the right panel, Saint Paul turns toward the Virgin and holds his symbol of martyrdom, the sword. In the center, the Virgin Mary wears a deep rich blue cloak made from ultramarine or lapis lazuli, a very precious and expensive pigment. A pattern of intricate marks called tooling, punched into the gold, defines the halo around her head. The background of the panels is covered with a thin layer of gold leaf, but the impression is of solid gold, meant to honor the holy figures depicted.As if she is extending into our space, the Virgin Mary reaches over the marble parapet with her right hand. This gesture symbolizes the holy Mother's power and mercy, and her unique position to serve for man as a compassionate link to God.During the 1500s, a reclining Christ Child was added in oil at the bottom, in front of the parapet. The child differed in style from the rest of the tempera painting.

An artfully disarrayed ribbon catches the rich black chalk curlicues of hair. Interspersed with the brilliant white paper, the softly modulated applications of graywashunderneath the hair and costume create a sense of glowing from within her young, clear skin.Danloux was as interested in capturing the young woman's inner world of thought and feeling as he was in representing her outward appearance. Her intense forward gaze hints at a strong personality. He may have made this portrait as one of a series of family portraits.","12 7 8 x 8 3 4 in.","Hybridsoft-paste porcelain","German","Vase with Neptune and Vase with an Allegory of Venice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00139101.jpg","Geminiano Cozzi","90.GA.4"

In the 1700s, it was difficult to serve food warm, since the kitchens were generally a long way from the dining room. The dish-cover or lid was a French innovation, invented to keep the contents hot while they were carried to the table or sat waiting for diners to arrive.It was not long before the decorative effect of the covers became as important as their function.

"1526","A silenos, or old satyr, a part-human, part-animal creature, reclines and plays the double flutes on this vase fragment. Companions of Dionysos, the god of wine, satyrs lived in a world of hedonistic pleasure. This silenos entertains himself by resting on a full wineskin. His white beard and tail, as well as the tufts of white hair covering his body, convey his advanced age. A small piece of a comic mask is visible just along the break on the upper left side of the fragment. This scene pokes fun at a popular contemporary scene on vases, that of Dionysos reclining on a couch at a banquet with a comic mask hanging in the background. Here the satyr mimics his master. This fragment comes from a squat lekythos, an oil vessel. The vase displays the lavish use of color favored by artists and their customers in the Greek colonies in Italy. This vase combines the red-figure technique used for the main design with the Gnathia technique of added color for the pattern work, a combination frequently used on small vases produced by the Workshop of the Darius Painter.","9 9 16 x 7 9 16 in.","Oil on panel","American","Card Players","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00059301.jpg","Josse van Craesbeeck","89.GA.9"
"1530","An astute observer of human nature and an often biting satirist, Honor Daumier here masterfully employed watercolor to illustrate the foibles of the French judicial system. Poverty forced Daumier to begin work at an early age; he once took a job as a messenger for the city's law courts, where he was exposed to the complexities and inequities of the legal system.  The strong, dramatic, diagonal of this composition focuses the viewer on the accused murderer. He leans over the dock to consult with his lawyer, who clearly controls the exchange, raising his right hand and seizing a sheaf of papers for reference. In contrast to the well-groomed and elegant lawyer, the criminal is wild-eyed and coarse. In the background a guard stands stiffly, oblivious to the exchange before him. In the gray courtroom, the empty space behind the guard suggests an air of anxiousness and uncertainty.","8 5 16 x 5 7 8 in.","Pen and brown ink","Italian","Study of a Lion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00027001.jpg","Lucas Cranach the Elder","2003.100"
"1530 - 1534","Known for his satirical, touching portrayals of contemporary life, Honor Daumier changed direction temporarily after seeing a newly hung collection of paintings by Jean-Honor Fragonard in the Muse du Louvre in 1869.Struck by the expressive power of Fragonard's rapid brushstroke, Daumier paid homage to his predecessor in a series of paintings that includedThe Studio. Daumier, who almost never portrayed beautiful women as objects of attraction, succumbed to Fragonard's sensuality and endowed this model with the upswept hair and casual off-the-shoulder costume of Fragonard's females. Emulating Fragonard's manner of sketching on canvas, Daumier made her dress shimmer, drawing with his brush to build the lights cascading from her blouse onto her full skirt.Aside from touches of gestural brushwork on the man's sleeve, the model's hair, and the woman's brilliantly illuminated skin and dress, this painting's darkerpaletteand largely subdued brushwork are consistent with Daumier's usual style. The artist hunched over his easel in the background also resembles his frequent depictions of painters or connoisseurs profoundly isolated by involvement with a work of art.","18 1 8 x 14 15 16 in.","Oil on panel","Italian","A Faun and His Family with a Slain Lion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 24485601.jpg","Lucas Cranach the Elder","92.GG.91"
"1948","Capturing Greek legend's view of Paris and Helen as the perfection of beautiful manhood and the symbol of womanly beauty and sexual attraction, Jacques-Louis David painted the fabled pair of lovers at ease in their love nest. The subject is love, expressed by the presence ofCupidand the drawing's sensuality, rather than Paris's abduction of Helen or the Trojan War that ensued as a result.As early as 1786, the comte d'Artois, brother to kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, commissioned a painting on this subject from David. David worked on the painting for at least two years and completed it in 1788. In this drawing and others, he developed a serene composition with affectionate gestures and a lavishly furnished antique setting. The composition and emotional tone of the final painting remained very similar, though Cupid and the tall lamp were eliminated.","12 1 16 x 16 1 2 in.","Pen and black ink, black chalk, and oil paint","French","Portrait of a Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00040201.jpg","Lucas Cranach the Elder","5 5 16 x 6 9 16 in."
"1949"," Through his Brutus as through his Horatii, [Jacques-Louis] David talks to the people more directly and more clearly than all the inflammatory writers whom the regime has confiscated and burned,  wrote a contemporary about Jacques-Louis David's paintings. David made this study in preparation for the well-known painting completed in 1789, the year of theFrench Revolution. Although it created a republican political sensation at theSalon, he had almost certainly not intended that reaction. He had chosen the subject from Roman history to satisfy a commission from KingLouis XVI.After Brutus, founder of theRoman Republic, drove out the kings, he followed Roman code and condemned his own sons to death because they had supported the monarchy. Lictors, or Roman officers, bring in his sons' bodies for burial, while Brutus sits impassively in the shadow of the goddess Roma. In contrast, his brightly lit wife and daughters succumb to grief at the sight of the corpses. David aimed for absolute historical correctness in figures, furniture, and costume; this style and specifically this picture decisively influenced the Revolution's fashions, furniture, and hairstyles.","69 1 4 x 94 7 8 in.","Brush and light and dark brown washes heightened with gray-white bodycolor (recto); brush and black and gray washes with touches of green over black chalk (verso)","French","Study of a Stag (recto); Study of Goats (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00007301.jpg","Lucas Cranach the Elder","84.XM.151.129"

While in prison, David made numerous portrait drawings of fellow prisoners, one of which is this drawing of Andr-Antoine Bernard, known as Bernard des Saintes, a lawyer who was eventually exiled for voting to executeLouis XVI.The portrait conveys the intensity of his subject's political beliefs. Bernard, who was forty-four at the time, poses stiffly in a high-backed chair with his arms folded resolutely across his chest.

The portrait was painted the year of her engagement to her cousin Lon Le Peletier de Mortefontaine, whom she married in 1806. The painting's small size and intimate mood reflect its private nature. Suzanne is portrayed bust-length, facing the viewer. Her dark hair falls in loose curls around her forehead, accentuating her large, dark eyes. She is fashionably dressed in pale muslin with a soft, black cashmere stole around her neck. Suzanne Le Peletier became a national celebrity at the age of eleven after the murder of her father, theFrench revolutionaryMichel Le Peletier.

In the 1699 French novelLes Aventures de Tlmaque, loosely based on characters from the Odyssey, the author Fnelon describes how Telemachus, the son ofOdysseus, fell passionately in love with the beautifulnymphEucharis. His duty as a son, however, required that he end their romance and depart in search of his missing father.The ill-fated lovers say farewell in agrottoon Calypso's island. Facing towards us, Telemachus's blue tunic falls open to reveal his naked torso. Eucharis, seen in profile, encircles Telemachus's neck and gently rests her head upon his shoulder in resignation. In this way, Jacques-Louis David contrasts masculine rectitude with female emotion.David paintedThe Farewell of Telemachus and Eucharisduring his exile in Brussels. The use of saturated reds and blues contrasted with flesh-tones and combined with a clarity of line and form typifies theNeoclassicalstyle, which is characteristic of David's latehistory paintings.","H:  18 1 4 x W:  15 3 4 x D:  7 3 4 in.","Red chalk over traces of black chalk","Italian","Saint Paul","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11201101.jpg","Giuseppe Maria Crespi","86.PC.463"

The folds of the carefully creased paper are realistically rendered, and the viewer can even decipher a Philadelphia address on the letter.Jacques-Louis David juxtaposed the sisters' different personalities through their contrasting expressions and attire. The elder Znade appears worldly and elegant in a low-cut black velvet dress. Sitting upright, she looks frankly out at the viewer as she protects her younger sister, Charlotte. Charlotte appears timid and reticent as she shyly raises her eyes, and her dress, a modest gray-blue silk, suits her demeanor.

The lack of accessories, the geometric simplicity of the shapes, and theclassicizingsquare form of the bust give the work an otherworldly effect. To augment this effect, the artist carved the face with smooth planes, left the pupils blank and unincised, and fashioned the large loops of hair on the top of her head in simple, clear shapes to bring out the figure's abstract qualities.The figure's remoteclassicismis leavened by thenaturalismof details such as her bumpy nose. Pierre-Jean David d'Angers captured the awkwardness of adolescence in his sitter, representing Mary Robinson as a shy teenager with her head demurely tilted forward and down, casting a deep shadow below her brows.Mary Robinson was the daughter of a merchant and sea captain with a route between New York and Le Havre, France.

"1460 - 1470","Jean-Jacques de Boissieu carefully framed his motif: an abandoned fortified house in Lyon known as Chteau Gaillard. Viewed from below, the ruins loom over the landscape; two minute figures in the foreground heighten the castle's imposing presence. Bathed in clear light, the two women are paired with two equally tiny pots of flowers, small symbols of a tamed and cultivated natural world. But for the most part, nature cannot be contained. Foliage and trees spring forth from the craggy inclines and ruins. Nature and the man-made intermingle and are brought closer together by a shared palette of browns and greens.As a draftsman, Boissieu is best known for drawings like this one: large-scale landscapes enhanced with gray wash and highlights of gouache or watercolor. Boissieu masterfully adapted his brushwork to capture nature's distinct and varied textures in a complex pattern of strong shadows and bright light under an extremely light and cloudless sky. Toward the left edge of the image, tiny dabs of blue gouache deepen the shadows.","2 ft. 8 7 8 in. x 4 ft. 3 in. x 1 ft. 8 1 2 in.","Giltbronze; brass; oak; enameled metal; glass","Italian","Barometer on Bracket","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00616401.jpg","Charles Cressent","71.DB.115"

He holds a chalice over which the host hovers, a reference to the celebration of the Eucharist. The stylized rays of light that emanate from Christ's form create a direct contrast to the subtle modeling of the folds of his robes and sensitively painted hands and face.

She was an immediate sensation in Jazz-Age France, which celebrated her perceived exoticism, quite the opposite of the reception she had received dancing in American choruses. American expatriate novelist Ernest Hemingway called Baker  the most sensational woman anybody ever saw--or ever will. Baron Adolf de Meyer, a society and fashion photographer, took this playful portrait in the year of Baker's debut.

The horse's lack of shoes suggests that this is a stallion kept for stud.De Vries executed more than a dozen bronze statuettes of horses and horses with riders, only four of which survive or are securely identified. This is one of the rare signed ones.

Dutch artist Adriaen de Vries based thecompositionof this bronze statue on a famousHellenisticmarble of a dancingfaun, which Michelangelo was believed to have restored while it was in the collection of theMediciin Florence. Although de Vries borrowed the original statue's composition, he replaced the faun's foot organ with a bellows and substituted plates for the faun's cymbals.This work of artistic virtuosity combines vitality and movement with balance. The strong S-curve on the figure's back demonstrates the complexity of his balancing act. The artist may also have had in mind the German wordkunststckemachen,which means both to juggle and, more literally, to make a work of art. The use of a verbal conceit such as this one and the exploration of a figure moving in space are characteristic of theBaroquestyle.","10 x 7 7 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Italian","Saint John the Baptist","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00410801.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."

The bearded saint sits in front of a barren and rocky background, his emaciated body a testament to his ascetic life. He directs his gaze to a crucifix that he holds in his left hand. During his time of religious contemplation, Saint Jerome was tormented by vivid hallucinations; his right hand clasps a rock with which he would beat his breast until the visions passed. A nook in the vaulted structure behind him holds his attributes: a cardinal's hat and a book referring to his translation of the Bible into Latin. A small lion inside the shelter recalls the fable in which Jerome pulls a thorn from a lion's paw, forever securing the animal's devotion. Ercole de'Roberti was artist to the court of Ferrara in northern Italy. The elongated forms, taut, linear rhythms, subtle colors, and meticulous, gold-flecked details of this painting convey the sophistication prized by Ercole's aristocratic patrons. This small devotional painting demands a focused concentration from the viewer that echoes Jerome's efforts to come closer to God.","9 15 16 x 7 7 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, andgold leafonparchment","Italian","The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00410901.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."

The sea goat carries Venus through the frothy waves, carved with energy and precision.John Deare displayed his great skill in carving a variety of levels and textures in this sculpture, from the low relief of the Cupid and putti to the smooth, half-relief of Venus, and finally to the sea-goat's fully three-dimensional snout and wavy strands of hair. Deare's depiction of Lust as a woman riding a goat forms part of an iconographic tradition that has been popular since the Middle Ages.","15 9 16 x 10 5 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, andgold leafonparchment","Italian","The Last Supper","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00411101.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."

The informal, extreme close-up view of Degas's face and his impassive, almost sullen expression echo the unpretentiousness of his clothing. The small-scale, informal presentation and lightness of touch emphasize the intimacy of this image and the still-tentative character of the young artist.Around 1857, when he was twenty-three or twenty-four, Degas traveled to Italy, where he spent much of his time making copies afterRenaissancemasters. The period was one of self-education and he drew prolifically, writing in one of his notebooks,  I must thoroughly realize I know nothing at all; it is the only way to get ahead.

"1469","Although the identity of the sitter in this portrait is a mystery, Edgar Degas conveyed her character by capturing the overwhelming sorrow to which she has succumbed. Posed with her head tilted and leaning against the back of her left hand, she appears weary. Her languorous expression and red-rimmed eyes, together with the limp right arm hanging at her side, suggest a physical or emotional malady, though nothing in the painting confirms the cause of her affliction. Hidden beneath a brown robe and full white gown, her pose is ambiguous; it is unclear if she sits, stands, or leans.The Convalescentattests to Degas's interest in the world of women--their physical characteristics and surroundings, and their complex emotional and psychological conditions.Unlike traditional nineteenth-century portraits, which were commissioned and usually left the artist's studio upon completion, this depiction of an unidentified woman remained in Degas's studio for at least fifteen years. The painting is unconventional in other ways as well;The Convalescentis more psychologically suggestive and spatially ambiguous than typical portraits of the time, such as Franz Xaver Winterhalter's official portrait,Leonilla, Princess of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Sayn.Degas's thick, unblended brushstrokes and flattened space bring the figure forward, conveying informality and intimacy.","3 3 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Italian","Saint Nicholas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00411401.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."
"1469","In 1877 Edgar Degas attended weekly soires at the home of his friend Ludovic Halvy, a writer of opera librettos and popular romances. At these gatherings, Degas drew portraits of his friends and made studies for his own work. He quickly filled this sketchbook with drawings that show his preoccupation with a variety of theatrical themes, including thecaf-concertand the ballet. When he completed the sketchbook, Degas presented it to his friend, who shared his passion for theater and music. Halvy later added inscriptions to many of the pages--a useful addition for scholars, as they distinguish Degas's contributions from those by other friends who occasionally drew in the book. Halvy inscribed the date1877and the wordsCroquis de Degas(Degas's Sketchbook) on the book's cover.During his lifetime, Degas filled thirty-eight sketchbooks, using them for a variety of purposes: recording the appearance of a work of art he admired or a person he observed, visualizing a fictional scene he had read, or experimenting with a new idea. For scholars, this important collection of reliably dated documents provides first-hand information on aspects of his working methods.","2 ft. 10 in. x 5 ft . 6 1 2 in. x 2 ft. 4 1 4 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Italian","Saint Benedict in Prayer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00411501.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."

"1469","In April 1877, the Impressionists' third group exhibition opened in Paris. Impressed by his friend Paul Czanne's painting on view there,Baigneurs au Repos, Edgar Degasmade two partial copies of it in his sketchbook. As his notebook was rather large and unwieldy, Degas probably sketched the painting from memory when he returned home, rather than in front of the actual scene.Degas focused on the standing bather from theforegroundof the painting, producing a rather quick, cruelcaricatureof her naked body. Her head is a simple circle, with two curved lines for eyes, a half circle for her nose, and a swirl of lines representing her tousled hair. Partially erasing her arms to set them at a sharper angle, the artist concentrated particularly on the body's unusual bent position, shown from the front and above.","53 3 4 x 44 1 2 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","Italian","Saint Catherine of Alexandria","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00411801.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."
"1469","Across two pages of his sketchbook, Edgar Degas drew the composer Ernest Reyer sitting at a long table among four washerwomen. The numerous gestures that revealed an individual's class and work fascinated Degas, and he focused on the laundresses' expressive faces and bodies. One woman rests her head on her hand, with a bottle and a half-empty glass beside her, her eyes closed either in exhaustion or an alcoholic stupor. The other two lean forward, absorbed in the developing relationship between the composer and the woman ironing. Reyer's intense gaze contrasts sharply with the studied indifference of the object of his attention.At the top of the page, Degas set the stage for the scene:  For a long time, Reyer has been offering a third-floor box [the cheapest theater box] to a washerwoman.  On the right Reyer sheepishly offers a piece of paper to a washerwoman, who holds an iron close to her cheek in order to judge its heat. There may be a sexual inference in Reyer's offer, especially since washerwomen in the 1800s often turned to prostitution to supplement their low incomes.","18 7 16 x 13 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Italian","Saint Dominic","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00411901.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."
"1469","Watching a procession through Paris's Left Bank in June 1877, Edgar Degas quickly sketched the various characters he saw that day. At the upper left, a hatless priest bends over to the right, while an elderly man with a turned-up collar looks down. Below them a young girl with a wreath in her hair holds a flag, and a man carries a bouquet of flowers. At the right, on a larger scale, a stout woman wearing a mobcap and a fringed shawl faces left. Various overlapping faces fill the corner behind her. In the center floats a man's head topped with a priest's hat--perhaps a self-portrait of the artist.Once when another artist invited him to go to a caf, Degas objected to traveling by horse-drawn cab, saying,  Personally, I don't like cabs. You don't see anyone. That's why I love to ride on the omnibus--you can look at people. We were created to look at one another, weren't we   For Degas, it was in the simple realities of everyday life that art could be found, not in dramatic tales from history and mythology.","9 1 8 x 8 3 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","Italian","Mary Magdalene Borne Aloft","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00412001.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."
"1469","An unknown man stares out to the left, drawn in a sharp profile that emphasizes his high-domed head and projecting beard. Edgar Degas first drew him with a much smaller head, then raised up his forehead and skull, giving the man a more substantial presence. Quick, parallel lines form the sitter's dark mustache, while softer, curving strokes create the paler wisps of his beard. Degas only lightly sketched in his subject's clothing, with merely a few lines to indicate the rounded collar of a dinner jacket and a black necktie.","9 7 16 x 16 3 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, silver leaf, and ink onparchment","American","Saint Peter Martyr","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00412101.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."
"1469","In the 1800s, when people depended on gaslight to light their homes, many artists put down their brushes at dusk and spent the late afternoon and evening in the many cafs around Paris. They gathered around the marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived to entertain them. One evening Edgar Degas quickly sketched the caf singer Theresa singingLaChanson du Chien(The Song of the Dog), a catchy little tune in which she imitated a dog as part of her act.Caught in full song, Theresa lifts her gloved hands to imitate the forlorn begging of a dog. Degas's quick pencil lines capture the fleshy width of her arms and chest, the ruffled edge of her low-cut gown, and her simple, upswept hair. With her open mouth and tilted head, she almost seems to be howling. A grotesquecaricaturein the upper right corner gives a crueler impression of the singer, with a gaping, toothy mouth, wrinkled eyes, and protruding nose.","20 x 15 15 16 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","American","Saint Anthony of Padua","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00412201.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."
"1469","Edgar Degas experimented by showing the robust curves of caf singers from various angles. On the left, a popular singer named Mademoiselle Dumay reaches down to an invisible audience, while a cluster of gaslights surrounds her head like ahalo. In the center, the stout body of a singer is seen from behind. Single lines suggest her wide chest and broad hips and the curling ringlets in her hair. A deliberately cruelcaricaturefills the right side of the sheet. Hair lifted into a rounded cone, she leans forward, gesturing with her hands. The rounded curves of her back and bustle echo the upward sweep of her hair.Degas was fascinated by the play of light over forms and generally chose to show the figures in his works under artificial rather than natural light. The glowing globes behind the head of Mademoiselle Dumay emphasize the whiteness of her face and her dark hair. Degas smudged the charcoal around her breasts and arms to suggest darker areas of shadow. He also used lines of parallel hatching around the singer to give the impression of greater depth to her body. The artist used this single figure as the basis for apasteldrawing,Mlle Dumay, Chanteuse.","27 1 2 x 24 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","American","Saint Bernardino of Siena","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00412301.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","MS.

"1469","Edgar Degas frequently used his sketchbook to work out new ideas for various paintings or lithographs. In this group of five quick sketches, he concentrated on the gestures and expressions of a singer at acaf-concert, several of which he later re-used. In the upper left corner, the caf singer who leans forward, her mouth open in full song, closely resembles apasteland lithograph known asMlle Bcat aux Ambassadeurs.At the lower left, Degas showed another vocalist in profile, reaching out towards an imaginary audience with both her arm and body. This figure appears again in the pastelLe Caf Concert des Ambassadeurs.The back of both another singer and a man with a high collar fill the upper right corner, while a woman bows in the lower right corner. A contemporary once described Degas as  an artist of rare intelligence, preoccupied with ideas which seemed strange to the majority of his fellows. Taking advantage of the fact that there was no method and transition in his brain, which was active and always boiling over, they called him the inventor of socialchiaroscuro.

The broad shoulders andbustof the singer Mademoiselle Dumay, drawn from two angles, fill the other half of the page. Degas created his figures using swift, abrupt strokes, as if he was impatient to record a posture or expression without sacrificing speed or spontaneity.

"1906","Focusing on the performer's expression and gestures, Edgar Degas quickly captured a caf singer absorbed in her song. Two black lines form her closed eyes, a small oval serves as her nose, and a circle is her mouth. With a quick flurry of strokes, her dress puddles around her feet, while an irregular zigzagging line forms the ruffled edge of her bodice. On the right, another singer makes a deep curtsy toward the upturned face of a male spectator.As a youth, Degas was instructed by his teacher Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres to  use lines, young man, many lines, both to remember as well as to copy nature.  Quick sketches such as these two were vital tools for the artist to record a specific performance he attended or person he had observed as he prepared for a more elaborate painting or print.","12 5 8 x 8 3 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","Dutch","Saint Anthony Abbot","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00412701.jpg","Taddeo Crivelli","84.XM.638.55"

Here seven young dancers fill the page with theirplis, lunges, and kicks. Often Degas did not even bother to sketch their heads, focusing instead on their bodies' contortions and their outstretched arms and legs. A flurry of lines captures their fluttering skirts and short, pulled-back hair.The writer Edmond de Goncourt wrote in his journal in 1873:Yesterday I spent the afternoon in the studio of a painter named Degas. After many attempts, many bearings being taken in every direction, he has fallen in love with the modern and, in the modern, he has cast his choice upon laundresses and dancers. . . .

"1745","Always captivated by gesture and motion, in the 1870s Edgar Degas became interested in ballet dancers and particularly in the youngest ballerinas of thecorps. During frequent visits to Paris's ballet school, he found what interested him most: movement--not free and spontaneous action but precise exercises. On this crowded sheet, one dancer practices at the bar in the upper left with her back toward the viewer, while two others with legs extended lean over on the right. It was the studied position of each girl's legs that fascinated the artist; he often did not even bother to finish the top half of the body. In the bottom right corner, he quickly sketched a group of four dancers, their heads together in deep discussion, with the observant head of the ballet master just visible behind them.Using quick, even careless strokes, Degas outlined the figures with abrupt lines as if he was impatient to record each woman's posture or hand movement in the most emphatic terms without sacrificing swiftness or spontaneity. He wasted no time to give depth to the forms with unnecessary shading or hatching; the finger he dragged over the tutu of the dancer at the top left created a smudgy shadow that simply suggests the garment's fabric.","13 3 16 x 4 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Hopi, Watching the Dancers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06011501.jpg","Edward Sheriff Curtis","84.XM.638.27"
"1642 - 1646","Stretching across two pages of his notebook, Edgar Degas sketched the interior of a brothel. While one soldier leans back in a drunken stupor, his head against the wall and legs extended, another soldier leans forward in deep discussion with a prostitute at another table. The establishment's madam watches the scene closely from a doorway on the right. Even in this quickly sketched scene, Degas draws the viewer into the drama by creating shrewdly observed characters. Fascinated by the countless gestures that revealed each individual's class and work, he produced pictures from things no painter had fully used before. Here the interlocking eyes of the prostitute and her client fill the center of the scene, contrasting with the madam's languid stare and the other soldier's relaxed position.Degas based the scene on Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa), published in March 1877. It tells the tragic story of a girl who becomes a prostitute, first in the country and then in a poor quarter of Paris near the cole Militaire.

The soldier leans back easily in his chair with his arms wrapped around his knees, swinging his legs like a young boy.Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa) was published in March 1877 and quickly caught Degas's attention.

Instead, he drew with increasing strength on top of his early strokes until he discovered a form he liked. For example, he redrew Lepic's left shoe several times as he experimented to find the correct angle. In contrast, Lepic's face was hastily but assuredly drawn and needed no corrections.

"1897, print","In the 1800s, when people depended on gaslight to light their homes, many artists put down their brushes at dusk and spent the late afternoon and evening in the many cafs around Paris. They gathered around marble-topped tables to discuss ideas with their friends or to watch the singers who arrived to entertain them. Edgar Degas quickly sketched two caf singers with sharply pointed noses and haughty profiles, bowing magnanimously to their invisible audiences. A quick flurry of strokes creates the billowing fabric of their dresses, and a circle suggests the unfinished upswept hair of the left singer. Why do you paint women so ugly, Monsieur Degas   one hostess unwisely asked the artist.  Because, madam, women in general are ugly,  he growled. Such a remark was more an example of Degas's famously quick temper than of his actual beliefs. Nonetheless, he never missed an opportunity to produce sharpcaricaturesof either friends or strangers.","20 7 8 x 16 1 4 in.","Oil on canvas","French","The Sisters Znade and Charlotte Bonaparte","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00092301.jpg","Jacques-Louis David","93.SA.56"
"1796","With her legs open and outstretched, a prostitute relaxes in a large, comfortable armchair.

Her loose hair hangs around her shoulders as she leans her head on the back of the chair and surveys the scene through half-closed lids. At the upper left, Edgar Degas began but never completed another sketch of her face.Degas used quick, abrupt strokes to capture the flowing fabric that covers the armchair and falls in gathers on the floor. The folds of the woman's gown emphasize the lines of her body beneath. Glimpses of her knees and the shape of her legs show through the thin fabric.Scholars believe that Degas may have based this sketch on a scene from Edmond de Goncourt's novelLa Fille Elisa(The Girl Elisa).

At the left, one faces to the left, with just the triangular tip of her nose visible from behind. At the bottom, one stands with joined hands. Two black lines form her closed eyes, a curved line her nose, and another makes her mouth. Another singer behind opens her mouth in full song as she gestures with one extended hand. Two other lightly sketched figures on the right face right. At the upper left, a carefully shaded sketch of a woman's head with downcast eyes is probably by another hand. Degas often passed around his sketchbook to allow others to contribute to it.In Degas's youth, his teacher Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres instructed him to  use lines, young man, many lines, both to remember as well as to copy nature.  Quick sketches such as these two were vital tools for the artist to record a specific performance he attended or person he had observed as he prepared for a more elaborate painting or print.","3 3 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Gum bichromate print","American","An Ethiopian Chief","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04263001.jpg","Fred Holland Day","2003.86"

"1785 - 1787","Edgar Degas captured the circus performer Miss Lala in her most thrilling act: Clenching a bit between her teeth, she was hoisted slowly to the circus rafters. Her strength and concentration are conveyed by the diagonal sweep formed by her outstretched arms. The gestural strokes surrounding her body echo this diagonal. Degas's colorpaletteheightens the dramatic effect; shades of electric blue contrast powerfully with Miss Lala's brown skin punctuated by a shock of black hair.Miss Lala performed her feats of strength and agility at the Fernando Circus, which opened in northern Paris in 1875. The Circus was a popular destination for artists. In addition to Degas--who lived nearby--Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Georges Seurat, each attended and painted the Circus. Degas was especially captivated by Miss Lala's arresting act and sketched her on successive nights in January 1879. This important study inpastelis one of several preparatory drawings that culminated in the artist's celebrated oil painting of Miss Lala's performance now in theNational Gallery, London. The pastel also reveals Degas's working process. For example, numerous pentimenti--especially in the thighs and right hand--show that Degas made adjustments to Miss Lala's pose on paper as she dangled above him.","7 1 2 x 5 1 2 in.","Bronze","French","Juggling Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00141001.jpg","Adriaen de Vries","96.PB.14"

They appear to be waiting, perhaps for an audition or its outcome. The two figures are a study in contrasts: The athletic dancer dressed in a dazzling costume reflects the glamour and artifice of the stage, while the shabbily dressed, bent figure represents the drabness of everyday life.Edgar Degas painted modern life; his subjects, including laundresses, milliners, nightclub singers, horse races, and the ballet, reflected contemporary Parisian occupations and diversions. From the 1860s onward, Degas frequented the Paris Opra, where he made numerous studies of performances, rehearsals, and backstage scenes. Later, he would refine and combine thesemotifsin his studio, in exercises of daring technical skill and compelling psychological subtlety. Here he demonstrated his complete mastery of thepasteltechnique. Delicately blended strokes are combined with bold hatching and emphatic slashes; pink, blue, and creamy tones describe the dancer in contrast to the dark, severe form of the older woman.","7 1 2 x 5 1 2 in.","Tempera on panel","French","Saint Jerome in the Wilderness","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00106601.jpg","Ercole de Roberti","98.SA.4"
"1857 - 1858","Two milliners sit at a dramatically angled worktable, their bodies partly obscured by the shadowed hat stands that crowd their work space. Seen as little more than a silhouette, the figure at right works carefully on a hat. Her attentiveness is not shared by her older counterpart who, though grasping a swath of pink fabric, appears lost in thought, gazing beyond the frame with a disquieting expression. The brightly colored ribbons--pink, yellow, orange, and green--draw attention to the drabness of the room and its inhabitants.Over the course of about thirty years, Edgar Degas produced more than twenty paintings,pastels, and drawings of millinery shops. Among modern painters, Degas alone depicted this subject matter with such frequency. His voyeuristic yet empathetic portrait of the milliner's private world focuses on the physical hardship of their work. The woman at the left embodies the painter's concern; even at rest, her wiry body and pallid skin registers a life of hard work and meager reward.","11 7 8 x 17 7 16 in.","Marble","French","Venus Reclining on a Sea Monster with Cupid and a Putto","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11342401.jpg","John Deare","83.DA.280"

From Guillaume Tasset, Degas obtained photographic supplies and sought advice about procedures, and from Tasset's daughter Delphine, who operated the photo studio, he ordered enlargements.

This intimate bond, at its strongest during the period of Degas's photographic activity, is apparent in Halvy's casual comfort in his home and in front of the photographer. By January 1898 their friendship had become increasingly strained and then altogether severed because of Degas's anti-Semitism and opposing political views.","8 3 16 x 12 1 16 in.","Graphite","French","Copies of Czanne's Bathers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13369101.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.3"
"1877","Women can never forgive me; they hate me, they feel that I am disarming them. I show them without their coquetry.Edgar Degas often depicted women in awkward and inelegant poses, eliciting sharp criticism. His comment above makes clear that he was aware of this response to his work. An early practitioner ofRealism, Degas captured women engaged in mundane tasks--laundresses ironing, prostitutes waiting for clients, and, most frequently, women bathing.The intimate subject of this painting, a woman bathing in a private interior, is one that invites voyeurism. Degas depicted the woman lying on a divan, while her maid dries or combs her hair. With her back pushed to the extremeforegroundof the images, she seems to hold the viewer at bay. Bracing herself with her left arm, the woman uncomfortably raises her left leg against the edge of the bathtub. Such unnatural poses have perplexed critics of Degas's time, as they do viewers today. Some see these poses as an attempt to depict human movement not in idealized forms, but in ordinary, private behavior. Others see such representations of women as misogynistic.","10 15 16 x 16 9 16 in.","Graphite","French","Reyer and the Washerwoman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13369201.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.4"

The blackened bottom of the model's foot suggests that the photograph was really made before, not after the bath. The casual setting is entirely fictional, and the towel and sofa are mere props for her unusual posturing. The model twists her torso in an unnatural position as the shadows contrive to decapitate her. Her contorted pose is purely formal; she does not appear to be drying any part of her body. Like many artists, Edgar Degas made photographs as preparatory studies for his drawings and paintings. This photograph may have been made in connection with a series of drawings devoted to the motions of women dressing and bathing.","6 3 8 x 9 1 2 in.","Graphite","French","Sketches of Procession","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13369301.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.5"

The coats of arms of various popes fill the window frame at the top.In 1520 this chapel was assigned to the Vatican's Swiss Guards, and shortly afterwards Perino was commissioned to decorate it. Scholars believe that this drawing was made around 1522 because it contains the coat of arms of Pope Adrian VI, who only led the Church for a year, from 1522 and 1523. Perino began work on the frescoes in 1522 but he never completed them because of a serious plague outbreak in 1523.

The stiff body of the dead hero contrasts with the sagging, limp posture of the bereaved Kaled.Eugne Delacroix displayed his skill at depicting a literary subject on a small scale. A brilliant colorist, Delacroix used rich shades of greens, browns, blues, and reds and scraped the paper in some areas to achieve certain textures and highlights.","16 x 20 in.","Graphite","French","Five Rapid Sketches","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13369701.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.9"
"1877","In this scene from Lord Byron's poemThe Corsair, the beautiful Gulnare, a member of the Pasha's harem, visits the imprisoned corsair or pirate Conrad. They fall in love, and Gulnare eventually offers to kill the Pasha and free her beloved.Eugne Delacroix drew and painted many subjects from Byron, in whose poems the artist found the emotional, exotic subject matter he sought. In orientalizing scenes like this one, he captured the struggles of the heart, matching his innovative use of color and loosely applied brushwork with unprecedented and controversial themes.Delacroix exhibited this watercolor in the Salon of 1831. Having learned the watercolor technique from his British friends, he used it both for independent works of art and as a medium for sketching nature. He aptly described his approach, saying,  The special charm of watercolor, beside which any painting in oil always appears rusty and yellowed, is due to the inherent transparency of the paper.

"1877","With his right arm outstretched, the part-man, part-horse Chiron teaches Achilles to hunt with bow and arrow. The young pupil follows the centaur's guidance and directs his weapon toward a target beyond the sheet's top right corner. The two figures hold relatively similar poses, conveying the emotional bond between them. The drawing also suggests movement and power: as the pair turn to the upper right, Chiron's horse-body hurtles diagonally through the center of the composition.In 1838, the forty-year old Eugne Delacroix received one of his most significant public commissions: the large curved ceiling of the Deputies' Library of the Palais Bourbon. Completed in 1847, Delacroix's decorative program illustrated the themes of Philosophy, Science, Poetry, Law, and Theology. Related to the theme of Poetry, this pencil drawing on tracing paper, is one of several in which Delacroix explored this dynamic composition. It was conceived to accommodate an unusually shaped section of the library's ceiling. Delacroix kept this work in his studio and returned to it more than twenty years later when he created a pastel of the same subject, also in the Getty's collection, as a gift for the writer Georges Sand.","8 3 16 x 12 1 16 in.","Graphite","French","Two Sketches","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13369901.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.12"
"1877","Dramatically lit and heroically isolated, a Moroccan horseman, fist upraised, charges across a ford, his horse rearing as it gains the riverbank. Behind them stretches an expansive plain where another lone horseman gallops towards a military encampment. The two rearing horses echo each other, just as the foremost horse's tail repeats the form of the weeds on the riverbank.In the background, under a turbulent sky, lies a chain of dark mountains.Delacroix drew inspiration for this painting from his 1832 trip to Morocco, during which he feverishly took notes and made countless sketches and watercolors. The horsemen he encountered in Morocco were among his favorite subjects. As his writings attest, Delacroix saw in them a living incarnation of the noble of spirit and terrible strength of will that he associated with the heroes of antiquity. He designed this small-scale painting for private contemplation, signaling a general retreat into a more subjective realm of exoticism and fantasy.","8 x 12 in.","Graphite","French","Ballet Dancers Rehearsing","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13370101.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.13"
"1877"," It is beautiful, even more beautiful, I believe, than the painting. I am enraptured, dear friend,  wrote novelist George Sand to Eugne Delacroix in gratitude for his gift of this pastel. It was the last pastel Delacroix ever made and his last present to Sand.Delacroix had first captured this subject--Chiron, the wisest of all centaurs, training Achilles in the art of hunting--on a corner of a curved ceiling devoted to poetry in Paris's Palais Bourbon Library, which he decorated from 1838 to 1847. On visits to Delacroix's studio twenty years later, Sand admired the new, rectangular painting of the subject the artist was working on. That canvas was promised to another admirer, so Delacroix made this nearly identical pastel for her and wrote to Sand's son, Maurice, informing him of the gift.Highly educated in the classics, Delacroix depicted subjects from antiquity throughout his life. Like his compatriot Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Delacroix used ancient marble sculptures as his source but to entirely different effect. Ingres's figures retained the cool purity of stone, while Delacroix used movement and color to animate and integrate nude, horse, and landscape.","12 5 8 x 12 5 8 in.","Graphite","French","Ballet Dancers Rehearsing","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13370201.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.14"
"1877","An endless expanse of debris and devastation convey the unparalleled power of the tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Meulaboh. In an instant, homes have been reduced to rubble; incongruously colorful shards are littered with clothing, personal effects, and debris. In the distance, the few remaining palm trees underscore the fact that everything else in the scene has been flattened, razed, destroyed. At the photograph's center, a single man embodies the tsunami's human toll. This despondent figure looks over the remains of his home, searching for anything salvageable and, most of all, remembering lives lost.French photographer Luc Delahaye took this photograph in early January 2005--about ten days after the Indian Ocean earthquake that triggered a series of devastating tsunamis across Southeast Asia. Delahaye had first arrived in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh; but finding the international press concentrated there, he traveled southeast to Meulaboh. In this photograph, he focuses his camera on a part of the city closest to the seashore and worst hit by the tsunami. From a distant, frontal point of view, his camera records the scene with detail and accuracy and includes an unusual peripheral vision that reveals destruction as far as the eye can see.Beginning in 2001 with the Afghanistan war, Delahaye initiated a series of large-scale photographs featuring significant events of recent history. On one hand, these detailed, frontal works relate to the tradition of documentary photography. On the other, their size and narrative power evoke nineteenth-century European painting. Compositionally,Aftermath in Meulabohrecalls Caspar David Friedrich's early 1800s paintingArctic Shipwreck--which also depicts nature's destructive power.","12 15 16 x 18 7 8 in.","Graphite","French","Brothel Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13370301.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.15"

Two putti pull at the wings of a second eagle that carries a pair of entwined spouts on its back. This fanciful scene is a design for a glass cup and is explained in the inscription at the bottom of the sheet: white wine should be poured into one tube and red wine into the other, so that the red wine fills the eagles and snakes, and the white wine fills the rest.Stefano della Bella began this work by creating a preliminary sketch in black chalk. He then worked the sketch using a finely sharpened quill pen. Avoiding hard outlines, della Bella used tiny hair-like strokes for the contours to define the forms. A blue wash evokes the presence of liquid inside a transparent shell.Della Bella made this design for a member of the Medici family in Florence. Elaborate glass table ornaments were common at the Medici court and often accompanied ceremonial banquets. However, this drawing's complexity suggests that a goblet constructed to its fantastic design never graced the tabletop at a Medici feast. Instead, it served as an example of artistic ingenuity, admired by the patron as proof of della Bella's imaginative powers.","16 x 20 in.","Graphite","French","Brothel Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13370501.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.17"

"1877","Dark, swirling clouds loom over a narrow strip of land, gently punctuated by far-off trees and a city skyline. The place is Rome. The weather: an impending rainstorm. The day: a late afternoon within the last decades of the 1700s.This painting is one in a series of cloud studies--in fact the 48th--that Simon Denis made to hone his observational and painting skills. Denis' confident paint handling and sensitive rendering of light capture the awe-inspiring power of nature. Using a warm palette, he juxtaposed light and dark tones to imply both the clouds' airy buoyancy and moisture-laden heaviness. Lively brushstrokes convey the constantly shifting forces of wind and light.This dramatic cloudscape predates by a century the Impressionists' celebration of outdoor landscape painting in which they recorded specific, yet fleeting, effects of weather and time and exhibited those results as finished paintings. But in Denis' time, oil sketching on paper while outdoors offered the artist an opportunity to test and sharpen his skills. Denis would have kept his cloud studies in the studio for future reference for his finished paintings.","18 1 8 x 12 3 16 in.","Graphite","French","Brothel Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13370801.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.19"
"1877","Beginning in 1778, the Svres Porcelain Manufactory produced garnitures of five vases to a design called thevases des ges(vases of the ages). These ornamental vases were made in three sizes: a large central vase with handles in the shape of bearded male heads, a pair of smaller vases with heads of young women, and a pair of still smaller vases with heads of boys. In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles. The scenes painted on the fronts of these vases showed episodes fromThe Adventures of Telemachus,one of the king's favorite books. The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Svres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates. This type of ornament was extremely fragile and was therefore used only on objects created for display rather than for use.At least one of these vases was modeled by the rpareur, tienne-Henry Bono. The design was created after engravings by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard and after designs by Charles Monnet. tienne-Henri Le Guay gilded the vases.","11 7 8 x 17 3 4 in.","Graphite","French","Sketches of a Caf Singer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13370901.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.20"

He used a light, delicate touch and concentrated on the outline of the forms with minimal internal modeling. The artist drew more broadly on the verso, using considerable black chalk underdrawing along with the brown ink. Here the Virgin and Child sit in profile on an elaborate throne ornamented with a sphinx, a curling rinceaux motif, and various floral designs. Given the profile format, scholars believe this sheet was probably intended as a study for a relief, perhaps in terracotta. Renaissance sculptors used drawings as important tools for numerous purposes: to experiment with new ideas, for workshop assistants to copy, or to tempt a patron with selections for a new commission.","11 15 16 x 18 1 4 in.","Graphite","French","Sketches of a Caf Singer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13371001.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.21"

Such screens were known asparavents(against the wind) and were usually kept folded in the corners of dining rooms or anterooms of the palaces. When needed, servants would arrange the screens to protect the occupants from drafts.The Savonnerie manufactory produced eight different designs for screens, of which the Getty Museum's examples are the tallest. Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay provided thecartoonsfor these screens in 1714, and Franois Desportes drew the birds in the central panels. Each panel has a yellow ground, while the flowers, leaves, and birds are woven in equally vivid shades.

The other two panels contain three waterfowl at the base; above, a blue and yellow macaw clings to a trellis of roses and squawks at an African crowned crane.

In a French newspaper he advertised a table whose description closely matches this console. A similar console table appears in a 1766 drawing by the French architect Victor Louis.

From a parallelogram-shaped base emerges a circular form inset with thin beams evoking the hands of a clock. A pair of black beams, shaped like an  L  on its side, juts away from the circle. At the top of the work, balancing on a thin black pin, fancifully cut forms interconnect to create a roughly circular shape. This circle includes the sculpture's one piece of recognizable imagery--an oversized pair of pliers.The myriad elements of Mark di Suvero's sculpture are sharp-edged and roughly formed. But viewed as a single object, the piece takes on an almost poetic wholeness. This unity is enhanced by the works kinetic properties. With the thick black beam serving as an essential counterbalance, many of the piece's surfaces can be set in gentle motion by the lightest touch or breeze. Despite variations in size and shape, the forms move in the same time and rhythm. Gandy dancer  is a slang term for a railroad maintenance worker originating in the late 1800s. Gandy dancer crews were known for accompanying their laborious, repetitive work with singing and dancing. Although the connection between this abstract work and its title is elusive, the jagged steel of di Suvero's sculpture and its kinetic elements can be related to the rhythmic labor on the railroad.","16 x 20 in.","Graphite","French","Opera Boxes","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13371501.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.26"

Diamond made the photographs both for the patients' personal records and to serve as aids in diagnosis and treatment. This patient's diagnosis is unknown, but the fact that the photograph was made in an insane asylum leaves open the interpretation of the scene. The way the woman cradles the dead bird with its limp, broken neck while wearing a surprised, slightly bemused expression presents an uneasy question of whether she mourns the bird's death or was the cause of it.","13 7 8 x 21 11 16 in.","Graphite","French","Sketch of Man's Head","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13371601.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.27"

In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Svres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.","16 1 16 x 11 1 4 in.","Graphite","French","Opera Fan and Ernest Reyer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13371801.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","95.GD.35.29"

The girl stares out from large eyes. Her wispy, shoulder-length hair is held back with a ribbon, and her upturned lips reveal a slight trace of a smile.Carlo Dolci's contemporaries greatly admired him as a portrait painter, although he preferred to be known for his religious scenes. Here his sharp eye for detail captured the pale fringe of hair that frames her forehead, the small, hooped earrings, and the rosy flushed cheeks. The delicate chalk strokes that shade her face contrast with the looser style used on her dress. A series of zigzagging lines describes the ornament on her bodice, while loose shading gives texture to the fabric.","34 7 8 x 47 7 8 in.","Graphite","French","Reyer and the Washerwoman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13695201.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","N20000307.2"

The large figures and compressed composition enhance the sense of his oppression under the massive cross and the cruelty of his tormentors.Domenichino paid particular attention to individualized types; the attendant soldiers and executioners seem studiously painted from individual models. A Roman soldier in armor and sandals leads the procession and gestures with a baton at Simon of Cyrene, who tries to assist Christ. Behind them, another soldier tugs sharply on the rope tied around the body of Christ and raises his right arm as if to strike. Shocked faces from the civilian throng that accompanied Christ to Calvary are visible between his legs. In the background are various figures: a man in a fringed red hat carrying a ladder on his shoulders and two more soldiers, one on horseback and another on foot.The painting's coloring has retained its strong impact because of the superior preservative qualities of oil on a copper surface.","32 1 2 x 20 5 16 in.","Graphite","French","Brothel Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13695401.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","N20000307.4"
"1877","Tilting her head back, an ecstatic Saint Cecilia gazes heavenward in an appropriate martyr's pose. Virgin martyr and the patron saint of music, Cecilia is thought to have lived in the 100s or 200s A.D. After laborers discovered her miraculously preserved body beneath the altar of the Church of Santa Cecilia in 1599, her cult grew strong in Rome, and artists portrayed her often, because she represented the union of religion and music.Domenichino probably made this drawing in preparation for hisfrescodecorations in the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, on which he worked from 1612 to 1615. Scholars identify this female head as Saint Cecilia based on its similarity to the Cecilia in that fresco, where she wears the same expression of ecstasy asputticarry her up to heaven.The pricking on this sheet shows that Domenichino's assistants probably transferred its outlines to another sheet, most likely the Muse du Louvre's much largercartoonfor the entire fresco. In theLouvrecartoon, Cecilia's head corresponds more closely to the fresco, so scholars assume that the Louvre cartoon was later.

Ha!  quoth he,  full plain I see,The Devil knows how to row. --Samuel Taylor Coleridge, fromThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner.Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poemThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerrecounts the tale of a young mariner's supernatural adventures at sea. This watercolor is a study for one of thirty-eight images that artist Gustave Dor created to illustrate editions of the poem published in 1875 and 1876.This scene takes place near the end of the poem (lines 564-569), after the Mariner is forever cursed for shooting an albatross. This slaughter triggers a curse that causes the death of the Mariner's entire crew, forcing him to navigate the seas alone for seven days and nights.This image illustrates the moment the masts of Mariner's ship disappear into a mighty white froth, shown at the center left. A pilot and his son have just rescued the Mariner, but thought him dead. When the Mariner instead takes the oars, as seen here at center, the men think he is the Devil and go insane. Dor depicts one of them slumped at the base of the picture frame, behind the Mariner. The other lolls over the right side of the boat. The dark, austere figure of the Holy Hermit, looms at the top right of the boat, perhaps signaling the misery awaiting the Mariner on shore, where he will be doomed to wander the earth for eternity to tell his story as penance.Dor's varied watercolor techniques and the work's large size both serve the drama of the poem.The waves, in their gloomy palette and multiple washes of brown, grey, black, and white, offer a convincing sense of depth and foreboding. White heightening evokes a splash of foam that ribbons up in the air like lightning on the front right of the boat. The Mariner is shown with his back to us, faceless, bracing his weight with his right leg against the churning waves, as if to emphasize the struggle of humankind against the wilds of nature.","7 13 16 x 6 1 8 in.","Pastel on faded blue paper","French","Miss Lala at the Fernando Circus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 25705701.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","83.GG.219"

"1895","An array of enticing visual clues has given rise to many theories about Dosso Dossi'sMythological Scene,but no one has determined the painting's precise meaning. The cupids in the sky, the lush setting, and the sensuous nude lying on a bed of flowers indicate that the subject is love. The male figure on the right is the Greek godPan, asatyr. InRenaissanceallegorieshe personifies lust, since he seduced thenymphswith the music of the pipes held in his left hand. The sleeping nude in theforegroundmay be the nymphEcho, who spurned Pan forNarcissus. The old woman at the center of the group could be Echo's protectorTerra, who sits above her and shields her from harm. Next to the old woman and dressed in a green gown, billowing red cape, and armor is a mysterious and yet to be identified woman. Her costume indicates that she is likely a goddess. Dossi painted this figure and then changed his mind and covered her up with a landscape. She was uncovered again during a restoration in the 1800s.Additional clues also tell scholars that the painting was cut down by about six inches on the left side at some point. The arm of anothercupidcan be seen at the painting's upper left edge, and a x-radiograph reveals the partially cut-off figure of a man under the lower part of the landscape.X-rayphotographs also display variouspentimenti, or alterations made by the artist.

There experts recognized it as an important, long-lost allegorical scene by the Ferrarese master Dosso Dossi.While the painting's precise meaning remains a mystery, Dosso's message seems to be that prosperity in life is transitory and dependent on luck. The nude woman represents Fortune, or Lady Luck. She holds acornucopia, flaunting the bounty that she could bring, but sits on a bubble because her favors are often fleeting. The billowing drapery is a reminder that she is changeable like the wind. Her single shoe symbolizes her ability to bring not only fortune but also misfortune.The man on the left personifies chance. He looks over at Fortune and holds up a stack of lottery tickets, which he is about to place inside a golden urn, a timely reference to the civic lotteries that had just become popular in Italy. The tickets may also refer to the painting's probablepatron,Isabella d'Este, Marchioness of Mantua.

The main lines of the bodies and clothing are drawn in black glaze, and the rest of the drawing is rendered with a brownish line made from diluted glaze. The words written between the figures are kalos inscriptions, praising Athenian youths. Large, white-ground lekythoi with outline drawing like this one are unusual in the early 400s B.C., yet three such lekythoi can be attributed to Douris.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to paint over the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes. However, because the white slip was rather fragile, by the mid- 400s B.C. artists limited the use of this technique to leykthoi used in funerary ritual.","5 8 x 1 2 x 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Portrait of Louise Halvy by Lamplight","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06145801.jpg","Edgar Germain Hilaire Degas","86.XM.690.2"

In addition to serving as a classroom, the gymnasion in its role as the center of Greek physical and intellectual life was also the center of romantic courtship.

The cupboard's large scale and exuberant gilt-bronze mounts reflect Eastern European rather than French taste. The cabinet was actually made for a Polish general, Count Jan Klemens Branicki. An inventory of Count Branicki's possessions made at his death describes both the corner cupboard and the objects displayed on its shelves: a collection of mounted Chinese porcelain and clocks, some embellished with porcelain flowers.The drawing of the corner cupboard, or more probably an engraving of it, must have caught Branicki's attention.

The Dutch maintained almost sole control of trade with China in the 1700s; the Chinese called them the  Southern Barbarians  and often depicted them on lacquerwork and porcelain.The size of the large Chinese lacquer panel probably determined this secrtaire's unusually low and wide shape. French craftsmen cut up the piece of lacquer, attached it to the carcass, and then paintedvernis Martinon the other sides and the frame. Scholars named this technique after the Martin brothers, who were granted a monopoly for making imitations of Chinese and Japanese lacquer in 1730; now the term refers to all French lacquer of this type.

Scenes of the rivers Seine and Marne were among the artist's favorite subjects, the foliage and reflections of sky and scenery were prime inspiration for his pointillist works.The pointillist technique creates an overall image through tiny spots of color. It allows the viewer to almost feel the artist at work, as one can pick out the precise taps of the brush tip against the paper. When seen from afar, for example, this vista's gentle curves, especially those of the bank of trees at right, capture a lush depth and even volume. Up close, however, one can appreciate how this pointillist surface is built up of precise groupings of varying blues and greens, with highlights created by the tiny dots of yellow and of white paper showing through.The palette of this particular work has several striking elements. For example, the choice of orange for the water and clouds creates a sense of excitement in what might otherwise be a purely languorous, even pretty scene.The present sheet is closely related to a painting depicting the same view of the Marne, dated 1888 and currently in the Muse d'Orsay, Paris. This drawing is unlikely to have been a preparatory study, and is instead a more abstract adaptation after the painting, perhaps completed for a collector as a finished work of art in its own right.The work is signed by Dubois-Pillet in watercolor at the lower right.","10 15 16 x 7 3 4 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish","Moroccan Horseman Crossing a Ford","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14333601.jpg","Eugne Delacroix","86.GG.728"

Fashionable women experimented with flowers and perfumes to achieve the finest fragrances, which were sometimes left to mature for up to nine years.Jean-Claude Duplessis, the artistic director of the Vincennes Manufactory probably designed the vases, which were namedpots-pourri Pompadourin honor ofMadame de Pompadour. In 1745 she becameLouis XV'smistress and a greatpatronof the factory.The dark blue ground color, invented only three years before this pair was made in 1752, was notoriously difficult to fire. Though not admired in its day, its uneven, textured appearance is greatly favored today. The painter, Jean-Louis Morin, based theputtiscenes on designs by Franois Boucher.","1 9 16 x 2 5 16 in.","Pen and ink and blue wash","French","Design for a Ewer with Eagles and Putti","www.getty.edu art collections images l 24182301.jpg","Stefano della Bella","95.SC.21"

The vivid color of their pink ground, a new innovation in 1757 when this set was made, would have been particularly admired because it was expensive to produce and difficult to fire. The pink decoration with its gilded outlines imitates molded water lily leaves.This pair is the larger of two sizes of ewers and basins of this shape made by the SvresPorcelainManufactory, only a small number of which survive today.

By the time the king was executed in 1793, less than half of the proposed 442 pieces had been completed by the Svres Porcelain Manufactory. For example, of the twenty-four wine coolers ordered, only nine were ever finished. Wine coolers were placed on the table or sideboard and filled with ice or cold water to chill the wine.Both the dark, even background color and the detailed reserve scenes are of the very highest quality and indicate that this wine cooler was made for a royal client. The dark blue ground color, known in the factory archives asbeau bleu(beautiful blue), was extremely difficult to fire. Without careful application, the color became patchy and uneven in the kiln or could bleed into other areas of the design. The central reserves are carefully painted with scenes fromclassical antiquity: one illustratesHerculeswhile the other shows Mentor.The reserve  Mentor at Salentum  is from an engraving by Jean-Baptiste Tilliard, after a painting by Charles Monnet.

"1719 - 1784","These coolers were designed to hold half-bottles of wine set in ice or cold water and probably once formed part of a large dinner service. With their fanciful chinoiserie scenes of gold and platinum pagodas on a black ground, the wine coolers imitate Chineselacquerwork. In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Svres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.","3 3 4 x 2 11 16 in.","Pen and brown ink over stylus underdrawing (recto); pen and brown ink and black chalk (verso)","British","Studies of the Virgin and Child","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00025601.jpg","Desiderio da Settignano","83.DD.260"

Bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel's 984-foot (300-meter) tower of open-lattice wrought iron was selected in a competition to erect a memorial at the exposition. Twice as high as the dome of St. Peter's in Rome or the Great Pyramid of Giza, nothing like it had ever been built before. This view was made about four months short of the tower's completion. Louis-mile Durandelle photographed the tower from a low vantage point to emphasize its monumentality. The massive building barely visible in the far distance is dwarfed under the tower's arches.Incidentally, the tower's innovative glass-cage elevators, engineered to ascend on a curve, were designed by the Otis Elevator Company of New York, the same company that designed the Getty Center's diagonally ascending tram.","4 x 2 7 16 in.","Knotted woolen pile","German","Pair of Three-Panel Screens (paravents)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00665301.jpg","Savonnerie Manufactory","75.DD.1"
"1855","As he hangs suspended from two nails on the cross, the weight of the man's figure brings his torso forward. With straightened legs, a protruding belly, and taut arm muscles, every part of his body seems to strain towards the viewer. Even the cross bows forward, accentuating the tension in the position. The man's sorrowful expression suggests that Albrecht Drer intended this as a drawing of the good thief, who repented his crimes as he hung dying on the cross beside Christ.Drer made this drawing in the studio; the forms became better defined as he went over the contours, outlining the body, chest, and abdomen with a stronger stroke. He then modeled the figure in three dimensions, using a combination of thin, parallel lines, cross-hatching, and short, rapid, repeated strokes. He probably drew the cross in last, after the figure was completed. The overall level of finish shows that Drer considered this a preparatory study, a place to work out a basic pose and proportions before making awoodcut, engraving, or painting.","5 13 16 x 5 9 16 in.","Wool and linen, modern silk velvet, wooden frame, modern brass nails","French","Four-Panel Screen","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00628401.jpg","Savonnerie Manufactory","88.DF.118"
"1987 - 1988"," It is indeed true,  wrote Albrecht Drer,  that art is omnipresent in nature, and the true artist is he who can bring it out.  TheStag Beetleis one of Drer's most influential and most copied nature studies. Singling out a beetle as the focal point of a work of art was unprecedented in 1505, when most of Drer's contemporaries believed that insects were the lowest of creatures. Drer's keen interest in nature, however, was a typical manifestation of the Renaissance. This beetle, rendered with such care and respect, seems almost heroic as he looms above the page.Drer probably made this drawing in the studio, based on quick sketches from nature and memory. The level of finish shows that he considered it an independent work of art, not a preparatory study. He used bodycolor to show volume, as in the hard, convex outer wings. Transparent washes represent light effects, such as the shadow cast by the body, which the legs raise off the ground. Seen up close, the creature's legs and spiky mandibles suggest its kinship to imaginary beasts in late Gothic depictions of Hell or the temptation of Saint Anthony Abbott.","5 1 2 x 6 1 4 in.","Silvered bronze,giltbronze,bleu turquinmarble top, modern marbleized wood base","French","Console Table","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00683401.jpg","Pierre Deumier","84.XM.485.29"

As both the arms of these men reversed the position of the rose and fleur-de-lis, Albrecht Drer could have made this design for an engraving.

He appears unaware of the precarious position of the earthenware pitcher in his left hand. The peasant's intemperate state showcases Cornelis Dusart's ability to capture the human form in an unusual pose, as well as his delicate modeling of the sitter's rumpled clothes and ruddy features.Continuing the genre tradition established by his teacher Adriaen van Ostade, Dusart specialized in depictions of peasant life. Like Van Ostade, Dusart produced studies exploring variations in pose and expression of single, seated figures. But the use of red chalk--often highlighting hands and face--was Dusart's own innovation.","7 1 4 x 5 in.","Albumen print","American","Seated Woman with Bird","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05185501.jpg","Dr. Hugh Welch Diamond","72.DA.63"

A handful of rough looking men gather to play backgammon, while others sit around, immensely enjoying their smoking tobacco. Men, women, and even children drink beer. Couples fondle one another in the more secluded spaces of a corner or balcony.Cornelis Dusart underscored his subjects' lewd behavior through suggestive details: rustic wooden furniture and earthenware jugs; food, pipes, and playing cards scattered about; patrons' ragged clothes and missing teeth. He used a sharpened piece of hard black chalk to draw on the smooth vellum and gray ink to define shadow areas; media that provide a light but fine rendering.The type of iconography depicted in this drawing was central to a genre of Dutch art in which everyday people are engaged in common activities. Drawings were often framed and hung, or simply pinned up, on the walls of middle-class homes. This large-scale drawing served as a finished work of art, but Dusart also made a painting of the same scene.","3 5 8 x 2 1 4 in.","Painted andgildedpine; gilt-bronzemounts;jaune ros de Brignollesmarble tops","American","Pair of Commodes","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00621201.jpg","Franois de Cuvillis","72.DE.53"

William Eggleston took the picture as part of his earliest series,  Los Alamos,  which he made over a seven-year period.For this print, Eggleston used color coupler printing, a quick, cheap process yielding  natural  color. From a color negative, he made a positive print on paper containing three emulsion layers of silver salts sensitized respectively to red, green, and blue. During development, he added dye couplers that joined to the silver particles to form three color layers. The superimposition of the color layers produces a full-color image.","7 3 4 x 5 3 8 in.","Point of the brush and brown ink and brownwashover black chalk, heightened with whitebodycolor, on light brown paper; squared with black chalk","Dutch","Equestrian Portrait of Don Juan Jos of Austria","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00047601.jpg","Jos Ximnez Donoso","84.GA.2"

In William Eggleston's minimalistcomposition, the incidental elements of the landscape--telephone poles, a fire hydrant, and the building--draw almost as much attention as this anonymous local man.Eggleston's image describes the empty, transitional, forgettable spaces between urban and rural areas of the South in the 1960s.

"1530","William Eggleston was initially influenced by his friend Garry Winogrand's philosophy of photographing  to see what something looks like photographed,  yet his own style is rooted in a personal approach. Here, he focuses on family members. His mother appears to yawn in front of the television. Eggleston's wife--seen in extreme close-up--smiles toward the camera. Her out-of-focus face and the older woman's blurred movement add asnapshotquality. The television, a symbol of suburban domesticity, sits prominently in the living room in front of a dramatic swath of curtains.Around the time this black-and-white image was made, William Eggleston had already met his friends and colleagues Winogrand and Lee Friedlander. Eggleston was still experimenting with a style that would not be fully developed for several years--one that later flourished in the medium of color. In this early work, though, the themes and subjects of his photography were already present.","8 3 4 x 4 5 8 in.","Oil on panel","Greek","Saint George","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13471801.jpg","Dosso Dossi","83.PA.15"

This makes you much freer, so you can hold the camera up in the air as if you were ten feet tall... Thus William Eggleston explained the technique he devised around 1976, choosing to aim his camera at his subjects while freeing his eye to look at the scene before him rather than at a defined portion of it through the viewfinder. His images are no less precise; here he captured both detail and a sense of space in this recently trod-upon landscape.","5 11 16 x 9 in.","Terracotta","American","Fragmentary Wine Cup with Achilles","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01238001.jpg","Douris","84.AE.770"

They don't care what is around the object as long as nothing interferes with the object itself, right in the center . . . . what they really want to see is a picture with a figure or an object in the middle of it. They want something obvious. The blindness is apparent when someone lets slip the word  snapshot.  Ignorance can always be covered by  snapshot.  The word has never had any meaning. I am at war with the obvious. Thus William Eggleston described his philosophy of picture-making. Indeed, the furniture in this home seems to have been assembled expressly to achieve the kind of central focus that Eggleston decried. Yet he chose to carefully place the organ just to the right of the picture's center and to shoot from an unusually low vantage point, so that the furniture seems to loom, holding court in the space.","4 1 4 x 6 3 16 in.","Pen and brown ink","Etruscan","Study of the Good Thief","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00004701.jpg","Albrecht Drer","83.GC.214"

Ulysses will overcome the sorceress and force her to restore his men to their normal shape.The tiny figures of Ulysses, Circe, and her entourage are secondary to the magnificently decorated palace, the lush landscape, and the assortment of lively animals.

"1640s","Isolated atop a mountain, a gaunt, tormented Christ dominates a nearly empty landscape. On a road leading to the walled city of Jerusalem, horsemen pass by the execution hill, literally turning their backs on Christ. El Greco's use of dramatic colors and exaggerated proportions distorts the figure, conveying the transcendent moment when Christ sublimated his physical pain and commended his spirit to God. Turning his eyes upward toward heaven, Christ looks away from the bones and skulls that lie at his feet, representative of his triumph over death. Light plays across his undulating form, illuminating his tortured body against the dark background. To heighten empathy between the viewer and Christ, the elongated but graceful figure appears alone. This private, devotional image was meant to encourage contemplation and spiritual reflection.Few paintings by El Greco can be entirely attributed to the artist himself, rather than his workshop. Scholars conclude that the bold handling of paint on this canvas, which includes undulating contours and vigorous dashes, confirms that El Greco painted it himself. Purchased by a Spanish family at a flea market around 1950, it remained in their possession until recently.","4 3 16 x 6 11 16 in.","Hand-coloreddaguerreotype","French","Father, Daughters, and Nurse","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05602301.jpg","Thomas Martin Easterly","92.DD.21"

"1410","Initially published as a limited-edition photogravure, this photograph of a man and a woman in a rowboat subsequently appeared in Peter Henry Emerson's first book,Life and Landscape on the Norfolk Broads.Emerson preferred book or album presentation so that text could accompany the image. He advocatednaturalismin photography, which meant that he believed photographs should represent nature as truthfully as possible without manipulation by the photographer. Emerson's writings indicated his passion for photography. He declared:   ...we must first see the picture in nature and be struck by its beauty so that we cannot rest until we have secured it on our plate.... He derived his subject matter from rural life in the marshy, coastal region of East Anglia, northeast of London. The book features images of laborers, and this peaceful scene is no exception: as the man rows, the woman gathers flowers to use as bait for fishing. Water-lilies were placed in a large bow net, like the one behind the oarsman in this image. The bow net was then sunk to trap tench, a fish common to these waters. Emerson sought a moment of tender beauty as the woman reaches into the water to collect a blossom.","6 1 2 x 9 1 2 in.","Limewood with modern gilding;Tegernseemarble top","French","Console Table","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00682601.jpg","Joseph Effner","MS.

Overcome by the beautiful Salome's skill as a dancer, the king had promised to grant her anything she wished. To take revenge on the Baptist, Herodias told her daughter to ask for the saint's head on a platter.Using a contemporary Renaissance setting, Cornelis Engebrechtsz. placed the king and queen on a raised platform with a dog gnawing a bone at their feet. Both women wear long, flowing dresses with tightly fitted bodices and elaborate headdresses to show their nobility. An ornate salt cellar sits on the table in front of Herodias. Engebrechtsz. conveyed the scene's emotions in the figures' subtle facial expressions: Salome gazes stonily forward at the king and queen, Herod appears displeased, and Herodias hesitates, perhaps drawing back into the corner. The artist used prominent painterly white highlights on the gowns, and his hatching technique imitated contemporary woodcuts. White bodycolor heightening indicates both the lighting and the volume of the forms with quick, fluid strokes.","5 13 16 x 9 1 4 in.","Temperacolors, gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchmentbound between pasteboard covered with redmorocco","American","Book of Hours","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00162501.jpg","Boucicaut Master","MS.

This common expression urging the drinker to enjoy the moment is typical of the friendly exhortations found on early Roman cups. Glass vessels decorated with inscriptions were extremely popular in the first century A.D. and were found throughout theRoman Empire. An artisan made this cup by blowing glass into a baked clay mold, a technique that originated in the first century A.D. in the area of Roman Palestine. This technique allows the mass-production of identical vessels. At first, the new technique was employed to produce ornate vessels, but simple forms were soon manufactured as well.","2 5 8 x 1 7 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","American","A Woman Harvesting Grapes; Zodiacal Sign of Libra","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00373801.jpg","Egerton Master","MS.

He might also have used this drawing as part of atriptych, flanked on each side byChristShown to the People and Christ Ascending to Heaven.With these early drawings, Ensor became increasingly preoccupied with portrayingJesusChrist. He began exploring the theme of Christ's entry, which evolved into his enormous painting,Christ's Entry into Brussels in 1889.Ensor used graphite to outline all the elements of this complexcomposition, emphasizing special areas with Cont crayon. His lively linear technique imbued the whole scene with tumultuous energy. He used a similar technique to establish the main masses, drama, and focus of the scene on theverso, sketching a subject that he may have contemplated including in the series.","4 15 16 x 5 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","American","Saint Mark","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00374501.jpg","Egerton Master","MS.

"1410","James Ensor took on religion, politics, and art in this scene ofChristentering contemporary Brussels in a Mardi Gras parade. In response to the Frenchpointilliststyle, Ensor usedpaletteknives, spatulas, and both ends of his brush to put down patches of colors with expressive freedom. He made several preparatory drawings for the painting, including one in the J. Paul Getty Museum's collection.Ensor's society is a mob, threatening to trample the viewer--a crude, ugly, chaotic, dehumanized sea of masks, frauds, clowns, andcaricatures. Public, historical, andallegoricalfigures along with the artist's family and friends made up the crowd. The haloed Christ at the center of the turbulence is in part a self-portrait: mostly ignored, a precarious, isolated visionary amidst the herdlike masses of modern society. Ensor's Christ functioned as a political spokesman for the poor and oppressed--a humble leader of the true religion, in opposition to the atheist social reformer Emile Littr, shown in bishop's garb holding a drum major's baton leading on the eager, mindless crowd.After rejection byLes XX,the artists' association that Ensor had helped to found, the painting was not exhibited publicly until 1929. Ensor displayedChrist's Entryprominently in his home and studio throughout his life. With its aggressive,painterlystyle and merging of the public with the deeply personal,Christ's Entrywas a forerunner of twentieth-centuryExpressionism.","4 5 16 x 3 7 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","American","A Noblewoman in Prayer before the Virgin and Child","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00374601.jpg","Egerton Master","MS.

"1965 - 1968","Reclining on a couch, an older balding man tilts his head back and sings, accompanying himself on the lyre. Several features of the scene, such as the couch, the pillow, and especially the wreath the man wears, reveal that he is a participant at a symposion or drinking party. Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use at such parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of revelry and drinking. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented problems for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to fit upright figures in this limited, curving space. Artists devised different solutions for this problem: some drew a line across the circle to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. On this vase, Epiktetos came up with a creative solution. He drew a line across the circle but made it the man's couch, rather than a ground-line. The edge of the man's mantle slipping down behind and below the line, creates the impression of depth and space. Epiktetos also used the circular frame of the tondo as part of the composition: it supports the man's pillow, and he props his foot on it.","5 x 4 11 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","American","Saint John the Evangelist","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00377501.jpg","Egerton Master","MS.

"1965 - 1970","A youth leans over to adjust the heel strap of his sandal, supporting himself on a staff. The precise identification of this figure is unclear: the youth may represent some mythological figure for whom sandals are meaningful, such as Theseus or Jason, or he may be a generic youth engaging in an everyday activity. The pose of this figure, standing but leaning over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C., yet this carver's skill in depicting a three-quarter view of the youth and in rendering the musculature in detail set this gem apart.Scarabs were pierced and generally worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the beetle side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When serving as a seal, the ring was removed, the scarab swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax placed on an object to identify and secure it.Greek gem carving changed dramatically in form, materials, and technique in the-mid 500s B.C. One of these changes was the introduction of the scarab, with its back carved like a beetle and its flat surface an intaglio. The scarab form ultimately derived from Egypt, where it had been used for seals and amulets for centuries. Certain features of Greek scarabs, however, such as the form of the beetle and the hatching around the intaglio motif, show the influence of Phoenician models, which the Greeks probably saw on Cyprus.","4 13 16 x 6 5 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","American","Job in Prayer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11100001.jpg","Egerton Master","98.XM.232.1"
"1965 - 1970","A youth bends over to scrape his shin with a curved blade called a strigil. After training, Greek athletes coated themselves in oil and used a strigil to scrape off the sweat, oil, and dirt. In part because it fills the oval space well, the pose of this figure, bending over in some activity, was a favorite for carved gems in the late 500s B.C. The difficult three-quarter view of the youth, the rendering of the musculature, and details such as the duck's head decorating the end of the strigil, however, display this artist's unique skills. The frequent depiction of athletes on gems of the late 500s B.C. reflects the interests of the men who owned them.A scaraboid is a simplified scarab. Rather than being carved as a beetle, the curved side of the stone is left plain. An intaglio design decorates the flat side. This scaraboid form gradually replaced the scarab in Greece in the 400s B.C.Scaraboid gems were pierced and worn as a ring or pendant. When attached to a metal hoop and worn as a ring, the curved side faced out and the intaglio surface rested against the finger. When needed as a seal, the ring was removed, the gem swiveled, and the intaglio design was pressed into soft clay or wax to identify and secure property. The ring in which this scaraboid is set is modern. As small, personal items, gems were easy to carry; although this example was made in the Cyclades, it was found in Sicily.","6 11 16 x 6 3 16 in.","Dye transfer print","American","Memphis","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13438901.jpg","William Eggleston","2000.41.6"

Although there is no fulcrum, the slanting line under the youth has been interpreted as a seesaw; thus the scene would show a feat of balance. Scholars call this vase shape a type ofoinochoe, which usually means a pouring vessel or jug, rather than a cup. In this instance, however, the vase is a mug that was used for drinking, ladling, or measuring liquids.Because of imperfections in its manufacture, this mug helps illustrate how Greek vases were decorated. In most workshops, the master painters would paint the figures and a small strip of glaze around them. An apprentice would then cover the rest of the vase with glaze. On this example, the apprentice carefully dipped most of the cup into a bucket of glaze, except for the side with the figure. He then set out to fill in the area around the figure with brushed-on glaze. However, the glaze he used for this final step was too dilute, so it did not turn a solid black when the vase was fired.","4 x 3 1 8 in.","Chromogenic print","American","Untitled","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13516601.jpg","William Eggleston","99.XM.13.3"

The party continues on the exterior of the cup. Men and youths converse, play musical instruments, drink, and dance. The revelry depicted on this cup was fitting decoration for a vessel designed to be used at a symposion, or aristocratic drinking party.The cup was broken and repaired in antiquity. When the stem of the cup snapped, elaborate measures were taken to fix the vessel, attesting to how much the owner valued it. A thin sheet of bronze, only as wide as the interior diameter of the cup stem, was welded onto a bronze disk, which fit snugly into the opening at the base of the stem. When this device was in place, the mender drilled a hole through the stem of the cup and the bronze sheet within, above the line of the break. He then threaded a bronze pin through these holes to anchor the pieces together.","4 13 16 x 4 13 16 in.","Chromogenic print","American","Untitled","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13516801.jpg","William Eggleston","99.XM.21.6"

In addition to athletic training, boys were taught the less strenuous arts of music and poetry, which were considered essential for well-bred youths to master.Although scholars do not know for certain where this vase was excavated, it was probably one of the huge number of painted vessels exported to Italy in antiquity. AnM-shaped graffito scratched under the foot of the lekythos was a trader's mark, used to identify goods in shipment. The same graffito is found on ahydriaby the Eucharides Painter found at Cumae in Italy, suggesting that the lekythos was traded to Italy, too.A lekythos was a vessel used to store and pour precious oil.

The youth, who is shown as just old enough to grow a downy beard on his cheeks, holds a walking stick and the case for the boy's flute.  He approaches the boy with a hand lowered toward his genitals, the standard gesture of young men courting boys. The inscription on the vase also refers to this Athenian cultural practice of men courting boys. A kalos inscription between the figures reads  Eucharides is beautiful.  Eucharides would have been one of the handsome adolescents in Athens in the years around 480 B.C., and the Eucharides Painter received his name from his fondness for this boy. A kalpis is a rounded variant form of ahydriaor water vessel. Greeks always drank their wine mixed with water, and a vessel like this one would have held the water at a symposion. The decoration on the vessel foretold the pleasures of the evening.","4 1 2 x 4 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Ft.

One arm is extended and covered by her aegis, her protective cloak edged with snakes.Partially preserved inscriptions written in thebackgroundprovide clues as to what the original scene on the krater might have been. They probably name Athena andPerseus, the Greek hero, indicating that the krater depicted Perseus, accompanied by hispatrondeity Athena, decapitating thegorgonMedusa.Euphronios worked in the newred-figure technique, which allowed painters greater ability to render realistic and three-dimensional representations of the human body. One element that allowed this was the fact that in red-figure the artist could draw interior details of figures either with dilute, normal, or thickened glaze, thereby giving them a sense of shading andmass. As can be seen here inAthena'shair, the dots of thick glaze standing up from the surface of the vase give the decoration a literal as well as visual three-dimensionality.","5 1 4 x 3 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Memphis","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13830601.jpg","William Eggleston","98.XM.230.7"

Details, such as the folds of his linen garments, have been rendered in dilute gloss. The curly locks of the god's long hair and hiskantharosare both painted black. Asatyrplaying an aulos approaches Dionysos from the right. Contrasting formally and iconographically with the ideal white god, his bestial acolyte is painted completely in theblack-figure technique. Thus, the satyr's anatomical markings are rendered by incision, rather than drawn with gloss.Because Dionysos was the god of wine, his activities were typically set in vineyards. Here, the grapevines are outlined byrelieflines and colored with golden dilutewash. The bunches of grapes that hang from the vines are rendered in relief. Such three-dimensional grapes, common in LateArchaicred-figure vase-painting, are unprecedented in white ground representations.A pioneer in the development of the red-figure style of vase-painting, Euphronios seems to have turned to potting later in his career. By the variety of shapes with which he is associated, we know that he potted vessels of exceptional size and complexity, including vases that combined the wheel-thrown, mold-made, and hand-formed techniques.","4 3 4 x 5 11 16 in.","Dye transfer print","American","Mississippi","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13426801.jpg","William Eggleston","84.XP.458.23"

"1873","Walker Evans was attracted to all things uniquely American, and this structure's mixing of architectural styles without regard for historical accuracy was certainly an American phenomenon. This bizarre house probably appealed to Evans because of its distinctive combination of Gothic Revival and Greek Revival elements. Obviously Gothic Revival, two large, side-by-side arches span the porch, echoed by the small arched window on the upper facade, complete with pointed shutters. The Greek Revival fluted columns supporting the upper story's porch appear inconsistent, suggesting that this home may have been altered in an attempt to adopt a more fashionable style.In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Americans typically looked to catalogs and pattern books to determine the style in which they should build their homes. They often drew from various sources, choosing whichever elements they fancied. This eclecticism was especially appealing to Evans, whose quest for the typical often involved the many places Americans called home.","3 1 8 x 3 1 16 in.","Pen and pale brown ink and gray-brownwashon off-white paper","Roman","Saint John the Evangelist and an Angel","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00001201.jpg","El Greco","2000.40"

Three rooflines dominate the composition and create a series of horizontal planes.

"500","[Walker] Evans's style is based on moral virtues of patience, surgical accuracy and self-effacement. In order to force details into their firmest relief, he could only work in brilliant sunlight, and the sun had to be on the correct side of the streets. Often many trips to the same house were necessary to avoid shadows cast by trees or other houses; only the spring and fall were favorable seasons. The forms were sharpened until so precise an image was achieved, that many of the houses seem to exist in an airless nostalgia for the pastSo wrote Lincoln Kirstein about Evans's images when Evans had his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1931 Evans traveled throughout New England photographing Victorian architecture. This study of the gingerbread, or decorative trimming, on a pump house in Kennebunkport, Maine, subtly juxtaposes clean, graphic shadows and highlights with the more fanciful ornamentation of the architecture. The lacy trimming of the overhang softens the stark, black rectangle of the doorway and the squares of the windows.","6 x 4 7 16 in.","Terracotta","Greek","Wine Cup with a Singing Reveler","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01415201.jpg","Epiktetos","81.AN.76.22"

Because illiteracy rates were high, ideas about voting and desegregation spread by word-of-mouth when people came together in small groups.It is difficult to know whether this topic spurred Evans to make the image. Although he was in the Deep South to photograph white sharecroppers forFortunemagazine, Evans had a habit of photographing whatever interested him. The architecture of the street and the assortment of goods on the sidewalk may have been what compelled him initially, but as a keen observer of people's habits, he was likely motivated by the individuals casually assembled in front of the store.","3 13 16 x 2 7 8 in.","Terracotta","American","Water Jar with a Reveler","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01408301.jpg","Eucharides Painter","77.AE.86"

Look at the quite handsome, charming building down front. While to the left, is a ridiculous house with a crenellated castle on it. The first is honest, the second is not honest; both are American.Walker Evans declared that he was not interested in  educated architecture,  but in vernacular styles such as those seen in this image of an industrial town. Using moral terms to compare the commercial building of the Pennsylvania Railroad in the foreground with the domestic architecture of a house in the background, Evans found the latter to be lacking in authenticity.Although architecture may have been Evans's primary interest, his inclusion of the railroad in the left-hand corner of the image added a dynamic as well as a documentary aspect to the composition. Since colonial times, New Jersey had been an important link for importing and exporting goods to New York and Pennsylvania, and Phillipsburg, N.J. was one of the earliest stops on the railroad.","4 11 16 x 3 7 16 in.","Terracotta","American","Fragmentary Mixing Vessel with Athena","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00906901.jpg","Euphronios","86.AE.313"
"13, 1927","Walker Evans claimed that he sought out his subjects  by instinct, like a bird, entirely by instinct. Like a squirrel too, burying and hiding, and divining where the nuts are.  This photograph reveals not only that he was adept at identifying compelling subjects, but that in front of his camera his subjects were entirely at ease.People and their way of life fascinated Evans. In this photograph he captured two individuals looking away from each other, as if the presence of the other person were of no consequence. Perhaps they are a couple so accustomed to one another that there is no need for acknowledgement. Perhaps they are simply looking out toward Main Street, observing the activities of their neighbors. The couple, their habits, and the consumer products behind them represent a way of life that Evans recognized as vanishing and that he specifically set out to record.","4 5 16 x 5 13 16 in.","Terracotta","American","Fragmentary Wine Cup with Dionysos and a Satyr","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01419201.jpg","Euphronios","84.XM.956.63"
"1928 - 1929","Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, with text by James Agee and photographs by Walker Evans, was published in 1941. The book focused on three tenant cotton-farming families living in Hale County, Alabama, during the Depression. Agee invented the name  Gudger  for the book; this family's real name was Burroughs. The Burroughses hosted Agee and Evans for nearly a month, and this photograph was made at George Burroughs's request.The family sits and stands against the side of their house, dressed in their best clothing, posing for a family photograph. George Burroughs, standing at the center, does not smile; rather, he looks proud and strong, his arms extended across the shoulders of his wife and eldest daughter on either side of him. The photograph shows the Burroughses as they wished to be seen and differs from other photographs of them that express Evans's view, portraying their situation more bleakly.","2 3 4 x 3 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Secondhand Shop Window","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05192601.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.40"
"1928 - 1929","Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, with text by James Agee and photographs by Walker Evans, was published in 1941. It focused on the lives of three cotton tenant farming families living in Hale County, Alabama. Frank Tengle, whom Agee called Fred Ricketts in the book, appears here in close-up, the deep, furrowed lines of his weathered face echoing the horizontal stripes of the clapboard siding on the shack against which he stands. He wears his work clothes; the stubble on his chin and oily disarray of his hair suggest that the photograph was made during or toward the end of Tengle's work day. The harsh sun against his face seems almost like an assault upon an already battered soul.","4 5 16 x 5 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Lindbergh Day Parade","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05190501.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.488.6"
"1928 - 1930","Informally seated on the porch of a small store in a Southern town as they gesture and tell tales, these two men present a quintessentially American image. Walker Evans made this image in Selma, Alabama, but for him this scene could have taken place in any small town in the South.Evans's aim was to capture the particular nature of American culture. People, vernacular architecture, storefronts, signs, and cars were some of his chosen subjects. Today these images recall a simpler time when leisurely summer afternoons were spent on porches talking with fellow townsfolk.","4 5 16 x 5 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Cityscape with  Stepped  Building","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04689501.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.11"
"1928","From mid-July to mid-September 1936, Evans took a leave from his position as an information specialist for the Historical Section of the Resettlement Administration to work with the writer James Agee on an assignment forFortunemagazine. They traveled to the Deep South to prepare an article on tenant cotton farming. In Alabama they documented the lives of farmers, including the Fields family. Evans found in this average American household the archetypal portrait of the everyman that he treasured. The straight-forward style of this portrait emphasizes the family's hard life as much as their pride.","4 3 16 x 5 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Coney Island","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05187601.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.49"
"1928 - 1929","From an elevated position, perhaps standing on a bridge or trestle, Walker Evans photographed railroad tracks receding around a bend in a small town. Several men huddle around a curb at the end of the station platform, while a solitary man carrying a package makes his way along the tracks beside a lingering snowbank. The blank gray sky, the heavy clothing on the figures, and the leafless trees in the background suggest the chill of winter. The image conveys sadness and a sense of desolation, despite the presence of people. Pushcarts sit abandoned between the tracks, and no trains stand at the station, and no passengers wait on the platform. The cars parked across from the station allude to the growing popularity of traveling by automobile rather than railroad.","3 9 16 x 2 11 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Manhattan","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05191401.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.52"
"1928","Walker Evans disliked the term  nostalgic ; however, looking at this view down Main Street in Greensboro, Alabama, it is easy to understand why people use this term to describe his photographs. The two-lane street seen here is lined with charming buildings that house a barber shop, a coffee shop, a telegraph office, and the Alabama Power Company. Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper advertisements abound, while traffic is limited to a single, moving car. In the background, the commercial thoroughfare gives way to a tree-lined street, which leads to the town's rural surroundings.Evans's documentary style aimed to record the slow-paced atmosphere of small-town America, where a mere block of one- and two-story buildings provided all the commerce in this farming community.  To be interested in what you see that is passing out of history,  Evans once said,  even if it's a trolley car you've found, that's not an act of nostalgia.

"1928","Walker Evans captured this informal image of Floyd Burroughs and his daughter Lucille at they sat on their porch in Hale County, Alabama. The man's tattered clothing and their lack of shoes demonstrate the family's economic struggle at the height of the Depression. During a month-long expedition, Evans and the writer James Agee documented the lives of three families of white Southern sharecroppers for an article inFortunemagazine. Evans photographed the interiors and exteriors of the families' homes, barns, and churches and made many portraits. Their work never appeared inFortune, but the resulting book,Let Us Now Praise Famous Men,published in 1941, became a landmark of social journalism.","4 5 16 x 5 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Architectural Study","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05194401.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.84"
"1928 - 1929","We live in a part of the country that some call The Bible Belt. Most folks around here go to church regular. Many of my friends have to go on Sunday and again on Wednesday Night.These words from a thirteen-year-old boy aptly describe the area where Walker Evans photographed this church interior. Worship was and is central to the lives of many Southerners. Evans spent a month in the South with the writer James Agee, interviewing local residents and making images of their way of life for aFortunemagazine story on sharecroppers.Rather than photographing the church full of worshippers, Evans showed it empty to emphasize its bare-bones simplicity. The ornate imported organ contrasts with the homemade plank pews and unadorned window. A small sign on the wall sets out six goals for the  100 percent pupil --presumably a bible student--awarding ten points for offerings, something few actually could have made at this time. An adjacent blackboard records attendance at class, including several picturesque misspellings.","3 3 8 x 4 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","East 14th Street","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05194501.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.117"
"1928","The only reason this photograph has any value is, an instinct is touched in it. . . . It's uproariously funny, and very touching and very sad and very human. Documentary, very real, very complex. All these people had posed in front of the local studio camera, and I bring my camera, and they all pose again together for me. That's a fabulous fact.Walker Evans was in the South a number of times during the 1930s. While in Savannah, he photographed this photo-studio shop front. Storefronts remained a consistent theme in Evans's work, but this image spoke to him in a particularly poignant way. Young women, servicemen, professionals, couples, children, sisters, and a father and his daughter fill the window, all tightly arranged. These were the subjects Evans sought: not celebrities in highly decorated studios but everyday people.","4 3 8 x 5 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Architectural Study, International Telephone Building","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05197801.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.138"

"1929","Walker Evans was born in Saint Louis and literally raised on advertising. His father, Walker Evans, Jr., began his career as an advertising agent and quickly rose to a position of copywriter, moving the family from Chicago to Toledo, Ohio, to pursue accounts. This upbringing contributed to Evans's astute observations of popular culture, particularly signs of all sorts, like this hand-painted advertisement for a dry cleaners specializing in the care of fur.Evans treasured signs as objects and collected them from street corners and antique shops. In a 1971 exhibition, he presented some of them next to their photographic representations.","4 5 16 x 5 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Couple at Coney Island","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05231401.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.5"

"1935","In the 1940s, Sarasota was one of few Florida towns that allowed trailers and provided them with running water and electrical hook-ups. The community, whose population was then a mere 8,000, also built laundries and social halls for the seasonal visitor. Walker Evans made this photograph while on a six-week assignment in Florida. He was hired to illustrate the 1942 publicationThe Mangrove Coast: The Story of the West Coast of Florida,a comprehensive book detailing the geology of the region and the legends of its explorers. Most of the pictures depict the habits of what Evans called  winter resorters,  retirees who seasonally descended upon the southern vacationland.Evans was fascinated by people's homes, often photographing their interiors and exteriors. Tenements in the Deep South, Gothic Revival cottages in the north, and even mass-produced trailers like this--all were of deep interest to him.","H:  4 ft. 4 1 2 in. x W:  2 ft. 2 1 2 in. x D:  5 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Highway Corner, Reedsville, West Virginia","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04120301.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.129.8"

In the background, a group of African-Americans watches the festivities, unable to participate. The occasion: an Independence Day parade in 1941.For Walker Evans, who sought to photograph uniquely American subjects, this stark juxtaposition illustrated the country's conflicted pursuit of cultural diversity and segregation. Although Evans was not interested in making social statements, he was keenly aware of the disparity between the lives of those in the parade and those who watched from the sidelines.Walker Evans made this image in Bridgeport, Connecticut, many years before the civil rights movement, while on assignment withFortunemagazine. It was published in a September, 1941 article, entitled  Bridgeport's War Factories.

"1935","Among low-priced, factory-produced goods, none is so appealing to the senses as the ordinary hand tool. . . . Aside from their functions--though they are exclusively wedded to function--each of these tools lures the eye to follow its curves and angles, and invites the hand to test its balance.Walker Evans's introduction to  Beauties of the Common Tool,  an article that appeared in the July 1955 issue ofFortunemagazine, makes clear his appreciation for the most ordinary apparatus. Photographing pliers, chisels, trowels, scissors, and bevels was a fitting assignment for Evans, who found items of everyday use intriguing. Using plain surfaces and extended exposures so that his large-format negatives would capture every nuance of texture, Evans transformed mundane tools like this crescent wrench into works of sculpture.","14 15 16 x 11 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Sidewalk Scene, Selma, Alabama","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05217101.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.496"
"1936, printed later","Although a century had passed since the railroad first came to America, it remained a popular subject for photographers. Photographs were initially used as advertisements for the railroad companies; they also educated people about the frightening  iron horse  that not only revolutionized transportation but also connected a continent. By the 1900s, photographers like Walker Evans found the peripheral, manmade materials surrounding the railroads a worthy subject. All signs, including this weathered artifact, particularly interested Evans.","14 13 16 x 11 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Part of Phillipsburg, New Jersey","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05234601.jpg","Walker Evans","94.XM.7"
"1936","Paintings by Evans are extremely rare and not widely known. This example strongly relates to Evans's photographs, most notably streetscapes from his seriesFaulkner Country, made in the late 1940s. The painting was a valuable addition to the Museum's collection of Evans's work (including more than one thousand prints), which, through its size, range, and quality, is a cornerstone of the photographs holdings. The very existence of Evans's painting demonstrates that photographers sometimes choose to give up their cameras to use traditional art materials.","14 7 8 x 11 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Main Street at Kingwood, West Virginia","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10657001.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.129.12"

The subject matter is vintage Evans: secondhand shop displays, window shoppers, sparse trees, condemned buildings, and new construction. He always preferred the decrepit to the new, the traditional to the modern, the dated manner of antique curios to current design.","14 15 16 x 11 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Bud Fields with His Wife Ivy, and His Daughter Ellen, Hale County, Alabama","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05215701.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.311"

"1938 - 1941"," After all, I am getting older, and I feel that nobody should touch a Polaroid until he's over sixty,  remarked Walker Evans in an interview the year that he died. He was introduced to the instantaneous Polaroid SX-70 camera and color film in 1972 and used it for two years, primarily making portraits of colleagues, friends, and students. Eventually he made more than 2,400 Polaroid images.In this photograph, Evans's familiar love of signs and words is evident in the cryptic message  DEAD END  that has been spray-painted on a metal sign. It is uncanny as well as ironic, given that the Polaroid camera marked a new and fruitful path in Evans's career.","H:  3 ft. 10 3 4 in. x W:  1 ft. 7 1 2 in. x D:  11 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05260301.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.771"
"1938 - 1941","The chilly letters that spell ICE on a steel background convey relief from heat on the hottest summer day. To emphasize how frosty the contents of this freezer are, the letters appear to have snow on them. Walker Evans made this picture from his personal fascination with lettering and graphic design. Throughout his fifty-year career, Evans photographed many types of signs--billboards, graffiti, theater marquees, and even traffic signs--each of which reflected his astute observation of popular culture.","3 9 16 to 3 11 16 x 12 x 9 3 16 to 9 5 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05260901.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.774"
"1938 - 1941","Walker Evans made this picture of an icehouse on a particularly sunny day. Bold red letters--ICE BLOCK CUBES--stand out vividly against a white background. Although a large tree shades most of the vending machine, Evans took the photograph when the sun fell almost directly on its facade, creating dynamic angular shadows. Beneath a blue sky with billowy clouds in a suburban neighborhood, the ice machine evokes nostalgic memories of the ice cream vendor, an everyday presence in many American childhoods.","4 1 2 x 3 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05261201.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.785"
"1938-41","An assortment of commonplace white traffic arrows painted on asphalt did not escape the lens of Walker Evans, who treated signage of every type with an equal amount of attention. Letters and symbols, whether painted freehand or with stencils, were all of interest to him. He made this picture from a pedestrian's viewpoint, which resulted in a dynamic angular perspective.The photograph's snapshot-like quality betrays the camera Evans used to capture this image: the newly introduced  absolute one-step  Polaroid. The simple Polaroid camera was a liberating tool for him in his later years. Rejuvenated by this new technique, Evans claimed that it could  extend [his] vision and . . . open up new stylistic paths.

"1941","Walker Evans, who was extremely fascinated by all types of signs and advertisements, made this photograph of a small store while on vacation in the French West Indies. The torn cigarette and candy boxes arranged along an exterior wall effectively notify potential customers of the goods obtainable therein. The proprietor of this shop used company graphics such as Coca-Cola and Marlboro in an innovative way--pasted together like a collage. The signs are vivid examples of typography and graphic design, which Evans also found fascinating.Like the images of general-store signs that Evans made in the rural South, this photograph venerates popular culture. Unlike in those early images, however, he used a Polaroid camera to make this picture. The lightweight one-step Polaroid was a convenient tool for the seventy-year old artist who was sprightly in mind but not in body. Although Evans sometimes referred to the Polaroid as a toy, he enjoyed  its simplicity as well as its color potential.

"1941","[T]ry for a record of an emotion rather than a piece of topography. Wait till the building makes you feel intensely.... Try and try again, until you find that your print shall give not only yourself, but others who have not known your intimate knowledge of the original, some measure of the feeling it originally inspired in you.... This will be 'cathedral picturemaking,' something beyond mere photography....Thus Frederick Evans passionately explained his approach to picture-making. The whole of the soaring interior of WellsCathedralcould not be contained within the frame. The verticality of the space is emphasized throughout, but the piers in theforegroundespecially shoot up from the floor with such force that they become abstractions, thick lines brushed in rather than solid forms in a three-dimensional space. The soft tonality of theplatinum printthat Evans preferred shades the contours of the space, and the even illumination throughout flattens the plane of focus, diminishing the viewer's perception of depth so that the space appears compressed.","4 1 2 x 3 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver prints","American","Subway Portraits","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05262901.jpg","Walker Evans","8 7 8 x 6 1 4 in."
"1941","Frederick Evans's architectural study of the attic at Kelmscott Manor, a medieval house, part of which dates from 1280, is a visual geometry lesson. Thecompositionis all angles and intersections, formed not only by the actual structure but also by the graphic definition of light within the space. Soft illumination bathes the area near the stairs, while the photograph'sforegroundplunges into murky darkness. The sharp angles of intersecting planes are mediated by the rough-hewn craftsmanship of the beams and posts, almost sensuous in their sinewy imperfection and plainly wrought by hand. Theplatinum printmedium favored by Evans provides softened tonalities that further unify the triangles, squares, and diagonal lines of the dynamic composition.","4 1 2 x 3 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","A Woman Shopper","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05237301.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.668"

He wore a boldly graphic dressing gown and slippers, and his wife Anne sported an equally intricate jacket. Her striped skirt and lace cap, the giraffe skin-patterned tablecloth, and the diamond-patterned footrest add to the abundance of ornament.Madame Eynard's steady, worshipful gaze may reflect the devotion of wife to husband, or it may indicate her desire not to move her eyes during the exposure.

"1941","The sweet intimacy of this family portrait--a friend's children and their nanny--is uncommon in Jean-Gabriel Eynard's work. He used careful planning to achieve the apparent informality suggested by the children's casual dress and slightly mischievous expressions. Judging from their leftward gaze, Eynard used something or someone out of camera range to attract their steady attention. With both children at the left, he artfully arranged the sober nanny's pose and skirt to fill the right side of the picture, balancing the three to form a sculptural group against the dark background.","13 3 16 x 18 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05252101.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.700"
"1941","Members of Jean-Gabriel Eynard's family and friends are gathered on the steps at Beaulieu, one of his country houses. Eynard's uncharacteristic absence from the scene indicates that he operated the camera himself, as well as posed the sitters. The patterns of the striped dresses and the delicately intertwined vines on the curtains add materially to the visual interest of the image.The three seated children, Eynard's great-nephews and great-niece, appear as young adults in a laterdaguerreotypeby Eynard.

"1941","Jean-Gabriel Eynard's lavish lifestyle required a large number of servants. Here, in front of a stable building at Fleur d'Eau, one of his country residences on the shore of Lake Geneva, Eynard arranged a groom, a coachman, and three gardeners holding the implements of their work: a broom, a rake, and a wheelbarrow. On the balcony above, laundresses pose among the drying linens.","9 11 16 x 14 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05254301.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.740"

"1941","On the back of this carefully lit and posed daguerreotype, Jean-Gabriel Eynard identified the seated woman as a cook, Lisette Gilliard, whose profession one might guess from her sturdy forearms. Judging by her suntanned face, her standing companion Suzette was probably a poultry keeper. Both women wear plain work clothes: sprig-patterned dresses, long aprons, and lace kerchiefs and collars.

The daguerreotypist himself, the third head from the left, peers out between the boy in a diagonally striped smock and trousers and Sophie Eynard, who holds her child's hand to keep him from squirming. Despite the careful arrangement of figures, Eynard achieved the overall effect of a spontaneous, almost playful grouping.

Clearly proud of his abilities as adaguerreotypist, he leaned one half of one of his panoramas of Geneva against his top hat. The color applied to his face and hands and the flower in his buttonhole was meant to heighten the appearance of reality and is unusual in Eynard's daguerreotypes.","Irregularly shaped: 18 7 16 x 13 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05260701.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.770"

Here, as usual, she sits with her elbow propped on a table, her gaze directed at her husband. Closely framed and intimate, the portrait's formal elegance derives from its tight composition of interlocking triangles, varied patterns, and a severe background. Oddly, Eynard seems not to have made solo portraits of his wife as he did of himself and of Jean Rion. Most of his portraiture was devoted to groupings of sitters, which he took pains to arrange informally.","30 3 8 x 43 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Subway Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05260801.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.956.775"

Out of deference to their employer or a keen awareness of the requirements of his hobby or both, the seven subjects successfully endured the lengthy exposure.

Eynard was well acquainted with stage design.

There are no known photographic portraits of Eynard by another photographer.In this self-portrait, he appears substantially at ease, sitting rather casually with his legs apart, his knees uneven, and his right arm draped over the chair. His sparkling eyes express his lively intelligence, and only the upright carriage of his head and the stiff gesture of his left hand, reminiscent of a pose often assumed byNapoleon, betray the stillness necessary for a crispdaguerreotype.","21 1 16 x 16 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Open-End Crescent Wrench, German Manufacture, 56 Cents","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05290201.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.96"

"9, 1963","Jean-Gabriel Eynard made this daguerreotype self-portrait with the assistance of his valet, Jean Rion. At nearly seventy years of age, Eynard presented himself as a distinguished, proud character, his attenuated, crossed leg kicking across the frame in perfect, almost dancer-like form. Believing that pose revealed a sitter's personality, Eynard chose the gesture deliberately.On the table Eynard displayed a daguerreotype of the temples of Saturn and Divine Vespasian in the Roman forum, possibly one that he made.  Although the complete title is illegible, the wordCAPODISTRIASis discernible on the large pamphlet placed on the chair beside him. Scholars have suggested that Eynard wrote the pamphlet in memory of his close friend Joannis Capodistrias, the martyred first President of Greece.

Eynard's attempt to avoid the usual formality of group portraits of this period is reflected in his subjects' casual attitudes.

The Joubert family were collectors andpatronsof the arts and supported the young Fabre's studies in Paris under Jacques-Louis David.

In honor ofLouis XV'sofficial mistress,Madame du Barry, they were namedvases bouc du Barry(goat vases of Barry). The Svres porcelain manufactory sold these vases for the high sum of three hundred and sixtylivres--an amount equivalent to six months' salary for a porcelain painter.Svres artisans made the vases from  true,  hard-paste porcelain, instead of the traditional soft-paste. The hard-paste porcelain recipe was still new, and the craftsmen were still experimenting with different types of decoration when these pieces were produced in 1778. Instead of glazing the vases with ground color and then gilding them, porcelain gilders first applied the gold onto the white body of the vases. Porcelain painters then added enamel colors within the gold outlines. Decorators also experimented with the use of silver on thetrellisworkas seen on these vases, but they soon abandoned this practice since the silver tarnished over time.","9 5 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Two Workmen near Central Park: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10829101.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.65"

Perhaps drawing from Plutarch's history, the artist frames the climactic event of Cleopatra committing suicide in the center, within a circularfriezeof the Battle of Actium. The four oval cartouches on the rim represent important events related to Antony: at the top, Antony meetsOctavianand Lepidus on an island in the river Lavinus to form the Triumvirate; on the left, Antony first sees Cleopatra when she arrives on an impressive barge on the river Cydnus; on the bottom, a banquet; and on the right, Antony kills himself.Although the basin's design derives from a sketch by Genoese artist Bernardo Strozzi, the highreliefof the figures, some of whom are modeled almost in the round, theManneristturbulence of the battle scene, and the use of depth andperspectiveindicate the work of a northern European artist, perhaps one fromFlanders. The detail and delicacy of the silverwork of this basin suggest that it was ceremonial rather than functional; it was probably exhibited on a buffet on the most festive occasions.","9 1 4 x 7 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Man Reading a Newspaper, Rockefeller Center: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10829201.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.67"

One figure places a consoling arm around the artist and appears about to whisper words of inspiration in his ear. Another figure, upright at the right edge of the sheet, moves toward the artist with a palm frond in her left hand. An ethereal, winged figure floats through the background. In the lower right corner, Henri Fantin-Latour's signature suggests that the drawing was conceived as an independent work of art.Fantin-Latour was fascinated with the world of the artist and produced both lifelike portraits of hisImpressionistcontemporaries and imaginative works exploring themes of creativity, inspiration, and vision. The three female visitors in this drawing may represent the sleeping artist's inner life and symbolize his frustrated search for inspiration. Fantin-Latour used the lithographic crayon to enhance this dream-like quality, shrouding the scene in mystery. The artist also scraped away areas of crayon shading to heighten the otherworldly mood.","9 3 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Man in Street: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10829401.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.71"

"1963","The sheer prevalence in number, of clowning and grimacing pictures, is an indication of what I am speaking of...not only were my  models  everlastingly ready to  cut up,  but I, too, must have been very ready to photograph their antics. My self critique led me to conclude that I was protesting against something in these pictures...I had judged the  official Bauhaustone-setters...guilty of taking themselves too damned seriously, and that they needed  taking down. Thus T. Lux Feininger recalled the mood informing his picturemaking during his time as a student at the German crafts school, the Bauhaus. This playful photograph shows three unidentified members of the Bauhaus band with their instruments humorously juxtaposed and a ladder that neither leans on any wall nor leads anywhere. The smiling man at the center, wearing a bow tie and bellboy's cap, strums the banjo held by the grinning man at the right, who in turn appears to singlehandedly support the ladder upon which a third man plays the slide trombone in a dramatic, downward thrust parallel to the lines of the ladder. Influenced by the Jazz Age, both players and photographers evoke the lively spirit of that revolutionary movement in music.","9 x 7 7 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Man with Laundry: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10830001.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.74"

The strong diagonalcompositionformed from Moscow's architecture is reinforced by the river bank and the sweep of barges in theforeground. To achieve this view, Roger Fenton set up his camera on a bridge across from the Moscow River. On the left, beyond the expanse of the river and a slender water tower, stands the recently completed Great Palace of the Kremlin. The octagonal bell tower of Ivan the Great rises just above and to the right. Another sixteenth-century building, the Cathedral of the Archangel, neighbors the bell tower.In September 1852, Fenton-who had only taken up photography a few months earlier-traveled to Russia with an acquaintance who was constructing a bridge for Czar Nicholas I. Perhaps recognizing that he was one of the first photographers to train his camera on Russia, Fenton made views of Moscow and St. Petersburg, capturing the distinct architectural character of each city. The cityscapes in this series are the earliest surviving photographs of Russia.","49 5 8 x 40 1 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Cook Standing in Sidewalk Cellar Door: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10830501.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.79"
"1963","In 1854, the British Museum embarked on an experiment to test photography's potential for recording art and artifacts. At an earlier time, historical and scientific specimens were recorded in the form of drawings or engravings. But the new medium of photography offered greater accuracy and efficiency, and the museum hired Roger Fenton.During Fenton's seven-and-a-half years photographing for the museum, this extinct creature's skeleton was probably his most unusual subject. Photography reveals the skeleton's scaffold support of thin wires, its many vertebrae, and its strange proportions-from a tiny head and long neck, to wide hips and giant talons.Fenton set up a studio within the museum and became very innovative at arranging and lighting his subjects. He developed methods that are still used by commercial photographers today. Against an interior brick wall, he hung white sheets to form a backdrop so that he could more clearly emphasize the subject's physical structure. Skylight windows probably lit this particular specimen, but Fenton also relocated art objects onto the museum's rooftop to record them in direct sunlight for greater clarity.","58 1 2 x 68 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Four Workmen: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10830601.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.80"

His was the first large-scale photographic documentation of a war. Field Marshall Lord Raglan was the commander of the British Forces in the field, whose distinguished military career included the Battle of Waterloo, where he lost an arm. In this photograph his sleeve is conspicuously pinned up in a kind of half-mast salute.Raglan sits in a doorway and looks away from the camera, his careworn body positioned at the boundary between light and shadow. Although the positioning is practical in terms of the light source, it is also metaphorical, placing Raglan on the cusp between a brilliant career and the twilight of life. The bright-white plumage of his hat lies across his lap like a dying bird. The bird is perhaps symbolic; Raglan was gravely ill with dysentery when the photograph was made and died within the month.","20 x 8 11 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Itinerant Knife Sharpener: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10830701.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.82"
"1973-74","...in coming to a ravine called the valley of death, the sight passed all imagination: round shot and shell lay like a stream at the bottom of the hollow all the way down, you could not walk without treading upon them...--Roger FentonFenton's most famous photograph is also one of the most well-known images of war. Across a desolate and featureless landscape, not a single figure can be found. The landscape is inhabited only by cannonballs--so plentiful that they first appear to be rocks--that stand in for the human casualties on the battlefield. The sense of emptiness and unease is heightened by the visual uncertainty created by the changing scale of the road and the sloping sides of the ravine.Borrowing from the Twenty-thirdPsalmof theBible, the Valley of Death was named by British soldiers who came under constant shelling there. Fenton traveled to the dangerous ravine twice, and on his second visit he made two exposures. Fenton wrote that he had intended to move in closer at the site. But danger forced him to retreat back up the road, where he created this image.On a commissioned assignment, Fenton traveled in 1853 to the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, where England, France, and Turkey were fighting a war against Russia. To avoid offendingVictoriansensibilities, Fenton refrained from photographing the dead and wounded. His more than three hundred images of encampments, battle sites, and portraits of all miltary ranks, became the first extensive photo-documentation of any war. When exhibited in England, Fenton's photographs of the Crimean War established his reputation.","4 ft. 3 in. x 3 ft. 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Railroad Yard Men: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10830901.jpg","Walker Evans","95.XM.45.83"

The Zouaves were French soldiers in a multinational allied army who fought in the Crimean War, where Fenton photographed them. The allied troops were made up of numerous ethnic groups. The Zouaves were exceptional not only for their colorfully exotic Algerian-derived uniforms, but also for their superior skill in battle. Fenton was given the uniform by a French general. Titling the image as though it were a photograph of an actual Zouave soldier but using himself as a model, Fenton forgoes accurate ethnic representation in favor of the romanticized play-acting in which he occasionally indulged.","19 1 2 x 13 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","British","Five Men in Suits: For the Series  Dress ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10831001.jpg","Walker Evans","93.XM.15.2"

After a disastrous fire and centuries of strife within the church, themonasteriesat Glastonbury were dissolved and the abbey became a quarry, although some ruins, like the ones in this view, remained.The ravages of time and the force of nature are evident.

A tourist guide of the early 1860s described this view looking up the valley as  one of the sweetest pictures on which the eye can rest.  At this  beauty spot,  as scenic views are called in Great Britain, the character of the valley changes from a lush, green pastoral landscape to rocky wilderness. Roger Fenton had this specific destination in mind when he set out to make the photograph. The railroad had recently begun to run only a few miles from the site, so Fenton conceivably could have used it to transport himself and his traveling darkroom, which was essential for the photographic processes used in the mid-1800s.Landscape photographs such as this one established Fenton's reputation as a photographer and were consistently successfully exhibited by him. One reviewer exulted that Fenton  seems to be to photography what Turner was to painting--our greatest landscape photographer.  Fenton was especially praised for his command of aerialperspective, the ability to convey the effect of distance on the flat plane of the photograph.","8 x 10 in.","Dye diffusion print","Swiss","St. Martins","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13465401.jpg","Walker Evans","84.XM.444.38"

The subject is Orientalist, a term that refers to romanticized depictions by European artists of scenes of Muslim culture in the Ottoman Empire and its territories in the Near East and North Africa.As in this instance, Orientalist scenes were more often fiction than fact.

Few nineteenth-century non-Eastern viewers could dispute their authenticity, since only a small number of them had actually visited such places.

But not everyone so easily accepted Fenton's images at face value; a more astute critic called for  the necessity of having real national types as models.

The recently completed billiards room, which was designed as a conservatory, is flooded with sunlight, illuminating the lavish interior and creating a dramatic pattern of light and shadows. Indoor photography was rare in the mid-1800s, but the abundance of light and Fenton's skill with the wet-collodion process created a remarkably detailed portrait of the space and its inhabitants. Behind the woman standing in the doorway at the very far end of the salon, a marble bust, mantelpiece, and mirror can be seen in an adjacent room.Mentmore House was a country residence of the wealthy Rothschild family, but little is known as to how Fenton came to photograph its interior or who the depicted individuals might be. Fenton accepted commissions to document several other country homes, and his surviving photographs of Mentmore House-both interior and exterior views-may have formed part of a commissioned album. Like Fenton's Orientalist scenes, this image reveals a high degree of staging.

She wears the golden crown--set with red gems to look like roses--that Bacchus gave her upon their marriage.Subjects drawn from classical antiquity--and this sculpture's frontal composition--were typical of Florentine bronzes from the early 1700s. Giovanni Battista Foggini arranged the two figures not to be seen from all sides but primarily from a single viewpoint in front. Despite the shallowness of the composition, the figures gracefully twist on their axes. Ariadne in particular assumes the form of a corkscrew, with her knees bending to her right and her shoulders swinging to the left. As was characteristic of sculpture at this time, the figures' bodies are much more expressive than their faces, which are emotionally blank.Foggini was working for the Medici when he made this bronze sculpture; after his death, his son sold a plaster model of the group to the Ginori Porcelain Manufactory at Doccia.

The father's large size, powerful musculature, and wild hair and beard contrast with his smaller, smoother-limbed sons. As retold in Greek mythology, the Trojan prince Laocon angered Apollo by breaking a vow of celibacy he swore to the god and then warning the Trojans not to bring the wooden horse left by the Greeks into the city. To silence him, Apollo sent serpents from the sea to kill him and his sons.Giovanni Battista Foggini's bronze of this story is based on a famous marble sculpture of the Laocon unearthed in Rome in 1506. The Roman historian Pliny had described this renowned sculpture in awed language, as  a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced.  Its celebrity prompted many bronze reductions, or smaller-scale copies including this one, made in Florence. Although it imitates an antique work, the emotionalism and frontality of this bronze are characteristics of the late Baroque Florentine style.This type of tabletop bronze was often displayed on a cabinet where it served as a souvenir of the  Grand Tour,  evidence of its owner's classical education.","19 3 4 x 29 13 16 in.","Oil on canvas","American","Portrait of Madame Joubert","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00079701.jpg","Franois-Xavier Fabre","70.DE.99"

The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum.

The side loops above the horned masks on the sides and the holes cut from either side of the base would never have been used to suspend the Museum's flask; they were retained as decoration and a reminder of the vessel's earlier function.Marine scenes decorate both sides of the flask: one of a triton abducting a nereid and one of two fighting tritons. This exceptionally rich and varied palette is typical of ceramics from the Fontana workshop. The son of a famous potter from Castel Durante, Orazio Fontana started his own workshop in 1565 in Urbino, helping to establish that area as the most important place for maiolica production in the late 1500s.","38 1 2 x 53 in.","Gelatin silver print","British","Bauhaus Band","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06089001.jpg","T.

"1855","Three studies of the head of a youth wearing a cap are placed harmoniously on a single sheet of paper. The top two studies show the young figure in profile. In the lower half of the page, the subject holds a more frontal pose looking downward and to his right with a fixed gaze. Composed of a series of confidently applied, curving strokes, the boy's black curls wrap around his ears in two of the studies and serve as a strong contrast to his light-colored cap. In the lower head, the boy's dark curls are also contrasted with short, light lines that delineate the nose and mouth.Although the three studies have not been connected to any known painting by Francesco Fontebasso, very similar heads of youths do appear in a number of his works. Scholars believe studies were a studio exercise used later as a reference for painted works.

Learning that he is to be released, the younger prisoner, his body uncoiling, reacts with relief. In sharp contrast, the older prisoner collapses in grief--Joseph has told him that he will be executed. The architectural backdrop reinforces these differing fates. The left side of the drawing is spacious and open, leading to freedom. The closed-off right side offers no such reprise; the older prisoner will never again experience the world beyond the barred window.The high degree of finish indicates that Francesco Fontebasso probably created the drawing for the album of a collector. The artist produced a series of biblical subjects in pen and wash, and this scene fromGenesiswas almost certainly included. The complex spatial setting, with its elaborately interlocking architectural elements, may have been inspired by Giovanni Battista Piranesi's series of engravings of prisons.","head","Salt print","British","Dinornis Elephantopus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06709001.jpg","Roger Fenton","84.XM.504.12"

By painting on a copper panel with painstaking brushwork, he gave his surfaces a polished smoothness similar to fine enamel.Forte was known for his sensitivity to the material nature of the objects he represented, capturing their solidity and roundness through light, shade, and color. Best known in his own day as a specialist in these fruit still lifes, Forte transformed the development of still life in Naples.

"1858","The Greek orator Demosthenes summed up a symposion as  revelry, sex, and drinking.  An integral part of Athenian aristocratic society, a symposion was a social gathering at which men ate, drank, played party games, were entertained with music and dance, and had sex with female prostitutes, mistresses, or male youths. Thisred-figurecup explicitly depicts a sexual encounter between a young man and a woman who is probably a hetaira, or prostitute. Such erotic scenes frequently decorated vases like this drinking cup, designed for use at a symposion and in keeping with the tone of the evening. The symposion was an essential element of Athenian social structure. Athenian men did not marry until they were in their thirties, and the symposion provided an important sexual outlet. Even after marriage, usually an arranged pairing with an extremely sheltered fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl, a man probably spent little to no time with his wife. Marriage was designed to produce legitimate heirs; the symposion with its music, games, and hetairai was designed to produce pleasure.","13 1 4 x 10 in.","Albumen silver print","British","View from Ogwen Falls into Nant Ffrancon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05998801.jpg","Roger Fenton","84.XM.504.28"
"1858","Simon de Varie, who served in the French royal treasury under Charles VII and whom the king had recently raised to noble rank, commissioned a book of hours, which was completed in 1455. This richly illuminated private prayer book includes a calendar of church holidays and texts for devotional services inspired by the eight daily services of the divine office. The rise in literacy among the merchant and noble classes and their desire to express a newly emotional personal piety, particularly in veneration of the Virgin Mary, spurred the popularity of books of hours in the 1400s. In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.","28 1 2 x 16 3 4 in.","Albumen print","British","Glastonbury Abbey, Arches of the North Aisle","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06711901.jpg","Roger Fenton","85.XM.169.14"
"1858","Introducing the reader and viewer to Simon de Varie's exquisite book of hours, a woman holds up an escutcheon, or shield, in the first illumination of the book's series of frontispiece miniatures. With its profusion of heraldry, Jean Fouquet designed this page to emphasize not only Varie's piety but also his pride in his lofty new status: Varie had only been ennobled shortly before he commissioned this manuscript.The shield was overpainted in the 1600s with thearmsof the Bourbon-Cond family but originally held Varie's arms. The banner supporting the shield displays Varie's motto:Plus que jamais(More than ever) andVie  mon desir(Life according to one's desire). Cleverness is the rule here: in the writing of theAandMthe letters are joined together in a monogram, and the second phrase forms an anagram of Simon de Varie's name.Inspired by his contact with ItalianRenaissancepainting, Fouquet painted the woman as a sturdy, three-dimensional figure. Modeling the volumes of her body on simple geometric forms--spheres for the turban and head and cones for her lower body and the individual folds of her dress--he imbued the scene with calm monumentality.","34 1 2 x 25 1 2 in.","Albumen print","Italian","Moel Seabod, from the Lledr Valley","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05998001.jpg","Roger Fenton","84.XP.219.32"

Together these two miniatures function like a diptych, a two-part hinged altarpiece. The image of Varie in prayer before the Virgin testifies to his personal devotion to her. It is also particularly appropriate as an introduction to Varie's personal book of hours, for in reciting his prayers he pays homage to the Virgin, much as he is pictured in prayer before her.Jean Fouquet's simple presentation gives this scene its grandeur. The Virgin and Child sit in three-quarter profile in a room defined only by its receding tile floor and deep red curtains. The Virgin's long golden hair, fine facial features, and narrow shoulders give her a youthful and delicate appearance, drawing on the contemporary ideal of female beauty. On the other hand, her erect posture and the fullness of her expansive robe convey a regal and powerful presence. Fouquet enlivened the dominant colors--shades of blue for the Virgin and Child's gowns and red for the wall hangings--with shimmering gold highlights.","59 3 4 x 74 1 2 in.","Albumen silver print","Italian","Pasha and Bayadre","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06666101.jpg","Roger Fenton","85.XP.355.25"
"1858","As part of the multi-page frontispiece to his personal prayer book, the patron, Simon de Varie, kneels in prayer to the Virgin. She appears in the miniature on the facing page, enthroned with the baby Jesus. Although not a soldier, Varie wears armor and a surcoat decorated with the fleur-de-lis. Behind him a female attendant supports a shield crowned with his family emblems, while similar coats of arms, now partially overpainted, and Varie's personal mottoes decorate the border. These signs of his new noble status are clearly significant to Varie, who rose from the merchant class through his work as an official in the French royal treasury.Although the artist Jean Fouquet presented Simon and the Virgin in separate miniatures, he linked the interior spaces of the two illuminations. The floor tiles on both pages share the same vanishing point, so that the lines of recession suggested by the floor tiles converge at a point between the two miniatures. This device suggests that, despite the red curtain behind the Virgin and the blue curtain behind Varie, the figures occupy the same room.","6 ft. 10 in. x 5 ft. 1 4 in.","Albumen print","Brazilian","Egyptian Dancing Girl","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06773801.jpg","Roger Fenton","92.XM.53"

This shield is crowned with the Varie helmet and crest.Scrolls at top and bottom display Varie's mottoes in elegant capitals. At the top and on the dog's collar, the phraseVie  mon desir(Life according to one's desire) incorporates the second letterIwithin theV, and theDbites theEthat follows it. This motto is an anagram of the patron's name, Simon de Varie.Plus que jamais(More than ever) unfurls on the bottom scroll. As with the manuscript's other heraldic images, this miniature celebrates Varie's new station in life, one that gave him access to the use of heraldry, restricted to the noble classes.

He produced many tree studies, of which this is the largest one to have survived. One of the first artists to draw nature for its own sake, he worked outdoors with a sketchbook so as to observe in minute detail and understand the effects of light. Although similar trees do appear in the backgrounds of the artist's paintings, this work was probably created as an independent study for his own use and enjoyment.

Fra Bartolommeo never finished his monochrome altarpiece either, though he was still working on it in 1515.Fra Bartolommeo used chalk to softly indicate areas of light and shadow as well as to work out other elements of the unified composition, such as the placement of figures and their various poses.

"1784 - 1786","As a student at the Acadmie de France in Rome, Jean-Honor Fragonard was encouraged to sketch Roman sites in the open air. In this view of the Palatine Hill's northeast corner, a site also sketched by his friend Hubert Robert and by Franois Boucher, Fragonard created a powerful visual momentum by coordinating the forward thrust of the corner of the palace, the brilliant sunlight, and the towering cypresses. The dynamic, plunging perspective of walls and trees and the intense light infuse the massive architecture with life.Fragonard masterfully used both chalk and paper to create the overall effect and the varied small passages. Overall, he worked the red chalk lightly yet broadly, allowing the white of the paper to come through even in areas of deepest shading. His controlled exposure of the paper's whiteness, the constant shift of direction and character in his shading strokes, and his inventive calligraphy describe sunlight, shadow, and texture in diverse ways.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Red, black, and white chalk (recto); red chalk (verso)","French","David with the Head of Goliath (recto); Two Studies, One of a Woman (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00031701.jpg","Domenico Fetti","93.PA.17"

The woman's pose, taken from representations of the penitent saint Mary Magdalene, the reformed New Testament courtesan traditionally depicted with long, flowing hair, further emphasizes the drawing's light, satirical tone.Fragonard's light, fluent washes also work to convey a sense of abandonment, evident especially in the wildly tossed-about bedclothes. These fluid passages contrast with the arresting precision of the woman's eye, nostril, and mouth, captured in small marks made with the point of the brush.In the later 1760s, Fragonard created a number of drawings devoted to erotic themes.

The story of the Garden of Love, an allegory of the nature and progress of love that has its origins in the poetry of classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, centers on this Fountain of Love. The fountain brings forth the water in which Cupid dips his arrows or from which lovers drink and fall in love. In nearly every period, artists have painted this romantic motif. During the 1700s, artists came to treat the Fountain of Love almost as a genre subject, with lovers in contemporary dress flirting in a garden around a decorative fountain. With this version, Jean-Honor Fragonard returned the allegory to its classical origins and imbued it with the thrilling rush of those first beguiling moments of love. The quintessential Rococo artist, Fragonard responded to the Neoclassical movement in an extremely inventive manner, adding a soft, steamy atmosphere to his cameo-like figures.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Gilt bronze","French","Pair of Wall Lights","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00636301.jpg","Pierre-Franois Feuchre","72.DB.89"

The figures, the still life objects, and the landscape work together as a unified scene, yet two different artists worked to create this painting. Frequent collaborators, the skilled figure painter Frans Francken II painted the women and background figures, and Jan Brueghel the Younger described the landscape.Such collaboration between artists was common in Antwerp during the 1600s, as artists often specialized in either landscape or figure painting. Flemish artists of the time repeatedly painted representations of the four elements, suggesting that it was a popular subject with buyers. The widely admired Brueghel the Younger depicted the senses, the elements, or the seasons as allegories many times throughout his career, either together or individually, as in the pendant to this painting,Landscape with Ceres (Allegory of Earth).","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Coloredwashes,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","American","A Battle from the Trojan War","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00593601.jpg","First Master of Bible Historiale of Jean de Berry","MS.

His wiry limbs highlight his athleticism and potential for speed, but also convey fragility. His nakedness, as well as the sculpture's pocked surface, reinforces this vulnerability. A minimally defined face reveals only an impassive expression--this is a human figure outside of time or place.Elisabeth Frink traced her interest in sculpting the male figure back to World War II. As a child, her family lived near an airfield that was visited frequently by Polish airmen who struck her as foreign and mysterious. According to the artist, many of her representations of men were influenced by these early memories and consequently she treated the male body as withheld, mysterious, and threatening.  In addition to producing many male busts, Frink created imposing, essentially anonymous men in a variety of poses or guises--standing, seated, spinning, winged, and on horseback. She began a series of running men in the mid-1970s. In this series, Frink explores and exploits the tension between strength and vulnerability, feeling and suffering.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Tonedgelatin silver printon postcard stock","Italian","The Thimig Family","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07042601.jpg","Trude Fleischmann","90.XM.104.8"

Her father was a skilled horseman and an amateur jockey, which added to an enthusiasm that continued throughout her life. But it was only when she moved to France in the late 1960s that Frink began creating sculptures of horses. She would continue to explore this subject for many years often representing a horse and male rider.This sculpture was made from a plaster cast created in 1980.

He then gave the painting to Clutterbuck. The two families maintained close ties throughout the nineteenth century, and the silver cup is still in the Clutterbuck family's possession.

The twelve signs of the zodiac wrap around the globe on a gilt bronze band. The maker, Grard-Jean Galle, fitted the bowl with a plug and explained that it could hold water and small goldfish,  whose continuous movement amuses the eye most agreeably.  When he exhibited the chandelier in 1819, he described it as alustre  poisson(fish chandelier).Galle tried to sell this chandelier along with other merchandise to the French King Louis XVIII in 1820. He desperately pleaded that these goods caused  the ruin of my factory and family  and promised that his stock was modestly priced, but the government rejected his offer. Conscious of popular criticism of governmental luxury, the bureaucrats argued that they could not purchase objects that were neither  advantageous nor useful.

"1750","In this depiction of the lamentation ofChrist, Fernando Gallego looked to Northern European paintings for inspiration but included distinctly Spanish elements such as a subduedpaletteand unidealized figures. Unlike Netherlandish artists who were interested in depicting the natural world in minute detail, Gallego concentrated on the piet's psychological and emotional impact, eliminating extraneous or distracting elements.TheVirgin Marysits in front of the cross, gazing at her dead son in her lap. On the ground around them are several pebbles, a bone, and a skull. A lance and a rod with attached sponge, two instruments from the Passion, lean perfectly vertically against the cross, which is inscribed with the initialsi.n.r.i.Behind the cross a rocky landscape overlooks aGothicwalled town, settled between a body of water and verdant countryside that stretches into the far distance.Gallego focused on the moment after theCrucifixionwhen overwhelming anguish gave way to resigned misery, the sentiment evident in the grief-stricken face of the Virgin, flushed and swollen from weeping. Christ's broken and emaciated body, his eyes unseeing, stretches awkwardly across her lap. Their exaggerated and unidealized features intensify the pathos central to the theme of the piet.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Painted andgiltterracotta","French","Theriac Drug Jar","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00140901.jpg","Francesco Fontebasso","2003.145"

"1455","Slowly, over the misty fields of Gettysburg--as all reluctant to expose their ghastly horrors to the light--came the sunless morn, after the retreat by [General Robert. E.] Lee's broken army. Through the shadowy vapors, it was, indeed, a  harvest of death  that was presented; hundreds and thousands of torn Union and rebel soldiers--although many of the former were already interred--strewed the now quiet fighting ground, soaked by the rain, which for two days had drenched the country with its fitful showers.This paragraph opens the text that Alexander Gardner wrote to accompany this photograph inGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.Both text and image eloquently capture the war's toll of death and destruction, especially apparent after the Battle of Gettysburg, which took place from July 1 to July 3, 1863. Although Gardner's caption identifies the men in the photograph as  rebels represented...without shoes,  they are probably Union dead. During the Civil War, shoes were routinely removed from corpses because supplies were scarce and surviving troops needed them.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Terracotta","Italian","Wine Cup with a Sexual Encounter","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01416701.jpg","Jean Fouquet","MS. 7"

General Reynolds was killed during the battle and had already been removed from the field. O'Sullivan made the photograph while working for Gardner, who printed the image and included it in hisGardner's Photographic Sketch Book of the War.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, gold paint, and iron gall ink on parchment bound between pasteboard covered with red morocco with olive and citron morocco inlays, gilt","Italian","Hours of Simon de Varie","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00172701.jpg","Jean Fouquet","MS. 7, FOL. 1"

"1455","A young girl in a prim white dress stands out in this seemingly spontaneous group portrait of passengers disembarking from railroad cars on a prairie in the midwest. The lack of a proper station platform, however, suggests that some passengers remained aboard the train and that this was a momentary stop to produce a contrived image. The conspicuous absence of women in the image is also a reminder that pioneering was primarily done by men: in 1850 only 7,000 of California's 94,000 residents were women.Alexander Gardner made this photograph two years before the completion of the transcontinental railroad, when the railroad companies were investing heavily in advertising. Many companies hired photographers to produce large images such as this one along their routes for documentary and promotional purposes. To create a sense of movement echoing the exciting advance of the train across the landscape, Gardner positioned his camera directly on top of the rails, with the Union Pacific train boldly emerging from the left and receding across thepicture plane.","6 x 4 3 16 in.","Tempera colors and gold paint on parchment","Italian","The Virgin and Child Enthroned","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00283801.jpg","Jean Fouquet","MS. 7, FOL. 2"

"1467 - 1472","Owens Lake is a very unique place in the United States. When the winter rains come, the lake fills with water; and when it dehydrates, it goes through several cycles. There's a little ponding of brine; it hasn't formed white crystals yet. Those will dry up before the year is out and turn white crystalline salt in place of that.--William GarnettMany of William Garnett's later photographs, like this one of Owens Lake, were shot in color. The orange-red diagonal shape resembles a flame with whitish edges, with surrounding hues ranging from cream to black. These colors indicate the presence of salt-eating microbacteria, representing a stage in the lake's annual cycle of flooding and drying out. Garnett made at least 100 images of Owens Lake during his career as an aerial photographer. Many of his commercial clients included geological and chemical industries, and the lake--located in the Mojave Desert--was along one of his frequent flight paths.Subjects like Owens Lake demonstrate Garnett's lifelong concern for the conservation of natural resources. The Owens Valley Aqueduct, built between 1908 and 1913, siphoned off the once-fertile valley's water for use by a growing Los Angeles population, creating an ecological disaster.","71 x 71 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Fifteen Leaves from History of Charles Martel","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00167501.jpg","Loyset Lidet","MS.

"1467 - 1472"," Art . . . stands as a uniting link between the soul and nature, and can be apprehended only in the living center of both,  wrote philosopher Friedrich von Schelling in 1807. Artists such as Heinrich Johann Grtner, who used landscape to evoke religious and spiritual ideas, eagerly took up this tenet ofRomanticism.With a fine-nibbed pen and a virtuoso technique, Grtner painstakingly differentiated species while creating an ornamental forest of dense yet delicate layers of plants. But he portrayed more than plants: his diminutive humans express a contemplative spirituality in which humanity is both immersed in and one with nature. The shepherd tending his flock and the religious procession approaching a chapel with a graveyard also allude to earlier religions, both pagan and medieval. In a manner reminiscent of Caspar David Friedrich, whose Christian art was similarly based in nature, the forest is hushed and waiting.","7 1 16 x 4 7 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Roussillon Going to Martel's Aid","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00479101.jpg","Loyset Lidet","MS.

"1467 - 1472","While still in his native France, Paul Gauguin yearned to escape the civilized society he knew. Wishing to imbue his art with a sense of primitivism, he sought refuge in a country he thought untouched by modern practices. Gauguin found the inspiration he was looking for in Colonial French Tahiti, where he made this life-size drawing of a rather defiant looking teenage girl. In the drawing, he boldly articulated her head, face, and neck, while indicating her shoulders and collar with lighter lines. But the girl's Western dress suggests that Tahiti was not the exotic land Gauguin had imagined: missionaries had destroyed its pre-European culture. Using flat, decorative forms, Gauguin presented Tahitian women as mysterious, unknowable creatures.","10 1 2 x 13 3 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Swiss","The Sons of Lydia Sentenced to Death","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00479701.jpg","Loyset Lidet","MS.

"1467 - 1472","I have just finished a severed kanak [Pacific Islander] head, nicely arranged on a white cushion, in a palace of my invention and guarded by women also of my invention.--Paul GauguinWriting to his friend Daniel de Monfreid, Paul Gauguin referenced in an almost offhand way this startling painting of a decapitated human head, which he made during his first stay in Polynesia in the early 1890s. Real events, from Tahitian King Pomare V's death soon after Gauguin's arrival, to the artist having witnessed a public execution by guillotine several years earlier, likely influenced its dark subject matter. Gauguin added the Tahitian words  Arii  and  Matamoe  in the canvas' upper left. The first means  noble;  the second,  sleeping eyes,  a phrase that implies  death. The notion of a human head ritually displayed in an ornate interior suggests the formality of a ruler lying in state, supported by the presence of sorrowful figures in the background. However, this scene doesn't correspond to actual accounts of Pomare V's funeral because the body wasn't decapitated. Gauguin was just as apt to fantasize about life in Polynesia as he was to document it. Bright reds, yellows, and pinks are juxtaposed with muted browns and purples to evoke a tropical sensibility. The rough, burlap-like canvas also hints at an exotic  primitivism.  In his collage-illustrated bookNoa Noa--which he began after his first trip to Tahiti--he included a copy of this painting and a comment that he thought of Pomare's death as a metaphor for the loss of native culture due to European colonization.Symbolist artists, including Gauguin, had a predilection for images of decapitated heads and any associated figures, such as Orpheus and John the Baptist. But in a more general sense, Gauguin also freely mixed Eastern and Western imagery. His obsession with the theme of death, which appears throughout his Tahitian paintings, is less a reference to spiritual beliefs or to what he saw around him than perhaps more significantly, how he viewed himself. Gauguin thought of himself as a martyr victimized by modern society, which compelled him to escape to a  primitive  culture.","17 5 8 x 12 7 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","English","Lydia Ordering the Death of her Sons","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00479801.jpg","Loyset Lidet","MS.

"1469 - 1472","Paul Gauguin may have carved this almost life-sized head as a symbolic self-portrait. He made the sculpture while living in Tahiti, where he studied the native culture and, to a great extent, identified with the local people. Despite his pampered upbringing, Gauguin saw himself as a  savage,  untamed by the civilizing force of French society.In this mysterious sculpture, Gauguin's own features are suggested, combined with Polynesian attributes, such as a broad nose. The hypnotic eyes and the smooth, warm surface of the finely finished wood are captivating. To Western viewers, the sinister horns suggest evil; however, in Tahiti, this attribute resembles a style of hair--bunched in knots at either side of the head--worn by young men as an expression of power.This intriguing and complex sculpture was probably displayed in Gauguin's home in Tahiti, but it was lost sometime in the 1890s. Until its rediscovery in the 1990s,Head with Hornswas known only from two photographs that Gauguin pasted intoNoa Noa, a manuscript meant to explain his painting and Tahitian culture to his European contemporaries.","11 x 8 5 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","English","The Representatives of the Pope Attempting to Reconcile the Fighting Parties","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00479901.jpg","Loyset Lidet","MS.

"1480s","If my work must be limited to watercolor, pastel, or anything else all the spirit goes out of it ... I have at this moment a series of experimental drawings that I'm fairly pleased with. I'm sending you a small specimen; it's like an impression and yet it isn't. Thick ink replaces pencil, that's all...--Paul GauguinNear the end of his life in isolated French Polynesia, Gauguin invented his own technique to produce this unique, double-sided image. Both sides depict a young Tahitian woman as Eve in the Garden of Eden, surrounded by the Devil as a snake, a dark figure on horseback, and a fallen Adam. One side of the drawing consists of fine blue and black lines. Those markings are not only flipped or mirrored on the other side, but appear thicker and darker amid murky patches of black and ocher ink. This more colorful and detailed side was probably what Gauguin intended viewers to see.On its surface, Gauguin's experimental drawing looks primitive and casually made. However, its rough appearance belies a very sophisticated work, with nuanced mark-making and carefully aligned applications of color. The closest analogy to Gauguin's process might be the act of writing or drawing on carbon paper, which transfers marks to underlying pages.Gauguin coated a piece of paper with printer's ink. He placed another sheet of paper--what was to become this drawing--on top of it and drew the initial composition with black pencil. Then he blocked-in shading with ocher ink. Third, he strengthened the outlines with blue crayon. The pressure applied by the drawing instruments transferred ink to the underside of the sketched paper. For these successive  printings,  Gauguin had to change out the original sheet of inked paper and allow the drawing to dry, at least partially, between passes of ink. Last, he took a brush dipped in solvent and blended some areas of the drawing, most notably behind the figure of Eve.Gauguin's long-term obsession with the biblical story of  the fall of man  enabled him to explore dual themes such as good and evil in a single work. As with many of his images, the way that Gauguin used symbols--their context and juxtaposition--complicate interpretation. For example, although Eve gazes directly at the viewer, it is difficult to tell whether her expression is confident or baleful. Her awkward gestures, one hand holding a cloth to her genitals and the other against her cheek, perhaps indicate shameful awareness of her sinful actions.This particular Eve and the head of a hooded figure behind her originate from a drawing Gauguin made at least eight years earlier. He repeatedly incorporated these exact motifs into subsequent paintings and woodcuts. In this case also, the horse behind Eve may be inspired by a frieze design from the Parthenon, which Gauguin had in his collection of source materials brought from Europe. The hooded rider incorporates some of Gauguin's own features, and may also symbolize Death.","10 ft. 10 in. x 18 ft. 10 in","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","English","The Conquest of Gasgogne by the Armies of Luxembourg, Boulogne, and Artois","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00480001.jpg","Loyset Lidet","MS.

The Getty Museum's drawing, rediscovered in the 1990s, is the only one among the original five known today.","23 x 51 1 2 in.","Pen and brown ink, brown and graywash, heightened with whitebodycolor, and traces of black chalk","American","Study for a Ceiling","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00013801.jpg","Bernard Molitor","67.DA.9"
"1972","Along a winding dirt path, the blind Belisarius carries his young guide. The boy has been bitten by a snake, which remains coiled around his bleeding leg. With his right arm wrapped limply around Belisarius's neck and his eyes closed, the youth balances precariously between life and death. Belisarius's eyes are also closed, but guided by his stick he moves forward with determination and purpose. He rises heroically against the spectacular sunset, a monumental figure creating a powerful outline against the sky. But the flaring sunset also signals a chill night and the uncertainty of the path ahead.Belisarius was a popular Byzantine general of the Roman Empire whose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In 1767, a novel by Jean-Franois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for artists--including Jacques-Louis David (Franois Grard's teacher), Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Jean-Baptiste Stouf (whose sculptureBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).For this painting, Grard both drew and departed from Marmontel's retelling of Belisarius's life. The general's young companion is present in Marmontel's novel. But to stress the bravery and pathos of the subject, Grard introduced the incapacitating snakebite. While Belisarius was typically depicted in the act of begging, Grard shows him standing and erect, his muscular form in sharp contrast to his guide's weakening body. The prominent helmet hanging from Belisarius's belt emphasizes the general's heroic past and underscores the injustice of his fall from favor.","26 x 18 in.","Oakveneeredwith mahogany and ebony;giltbronzemounts;griotte de Flandremarble top","American","Rolltop Desk","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00607701.jpg","Hctor Garca","98.XM.147.2"
"2, 1862","Thodore Gricault carried this little book around in his pocket for more than two years, from 1812 to 1814. He used it to make rapid sketches from life and to copymotifsfromOld Masterpaintings and ancient sculpture, as well as to note ideas for future projects. The sketchbook clearly illustrates his broad range of interests, though it focuses on subjects such as horses and lions, which interested Gricault throughout his career.After Gricault's early death at the age of thirty-two in 1824, the contents of his studio, including thirty-three sketchbooks, were sold at auction. Most of these sketchbooks were later taken apart, and their individual pages have scattered among various private and public collections. Only six remain intact today. The Getty Museum's sketchbook is nearly complete, with a few detached single sheets showing that a few pages were cut or torn out at some point.","23 x 29 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Visita Kennedy, Avenida 20 Noviembre","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11365601.jpg","Hctor Garca","98.XM.147.6"

Gricault is said to have drawn his inspiration for the scene from seeing a carriage horse bolt on the outskirts of Paris. Still an inexperienced draftsman, he found the scene difficult and experimented numerous times, in pencil and in oils, before arriving at the finalcomposition.","17 1 4 x 13 1 4 in.","Albumen print","American","Group at Junction, Kansas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06722901.jpg","Alexander Gardner","84.XM.1027.21"

In this page from one of his many dismantled sketchbooks, both therectoandversocontain numerous drawings of horses. On the front or recto, Gricault experimented with placing different liveried officers on the backs of rearing horses. Although he varied the uniform, helmets, and swords of the officers, the prancing animals set at various angles appear to have the most energy. Gricault's animated pencil moved vigorously across the sheet, creating flowing tails and prancing feet with quick, sure strokes.On the back or verso, Gricault concentrated on bold renderings of horses alone. He practiced on four heads in the corner, while the central figures focus more on stance. The swirling lines that effortlessly suggest the head and manes of the animals blend into strong, muscular bodies with the addition of shaded lines. These quick sketches contrast sharply with the painstaking detail of a single hoof, where Gricault showed the nail studs of the horseshoe, the hairy fetlock, and strong bone structure with careful precision.","Mounted: 3 3 8 x 6 15 16 in.","Temperaand gold leaf on panel","French","Coronation of the Virgin","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00073601.jpg","Orazio Gentileschi","98.PA.10"
"1796","As a boy, Thodore Gricault loved drawing horses and would sit in the stables watching and drawing. In 1817, he traveled to Rome where he witnessed the annual Carnival horse race and subsequently made numerous studies of this spectacle. This study marks the moment just before the race begins, when the terrified riderless horses begin their run down the Corso in Rome.A groom tries to contain a rearing horse in the center, while other men all around push and pull the wild animals, goading them into a frenzied stampede. Gricault used virtually monochromatic colors applied in thick swirls to animate and suggest extreme physical strength. The dramatic use of light and shadow adds energy to the relieflike scene. Gricault mythologized the event: the muscular nude in the center recalls athletes of ancient Greece, and the thrusting horses bring to mind the Parthenonfriezedesigned by Phidias. Gricault intended to use this study for a grand painting to submit to theSalon, but he had to abandon that plan when he was called back to France on short notice.","2 ft. 3 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 7 3 4 in. x 10 1 2 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Lot and His Daughters","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11638901.jpg","Paul Georges","88.DA.49"

Encoiled in her lover's arms and with her legs provocatively exposed, the woman in white is an active participant in the amorous act rather than a passive object. With a modern directness, Gricault captured the intensity and energy of human sexuality in a manner very different from the idealizing conventions of his age.Gricault 's expressive handling of line and paint accords with the passionate energy of the subject matter.

Gricault captured the man's character with great sympathy and spontaneity; his watery eyes do not focus on anything outside the canvas but appear to express an internal torment.

The dramatic story of an Arab Christian living as an infidel within his Muslim homeland tapped the vogue for Orientalism, which stemmed in part from Napoleon's recent campaigns in Egypt and Syria. Gricault's choice of subject matter was also affected by his passion for horses, which he often represented with great sensitivity.On a visit to England in 1820, Gricault learned the British style of watercolor painting, which emphasized translucentwashesthat allowed the white of the paper to shine through. After faintly sketching thegiaouron theversoof this sheet, he used the translucency of the watercolor to render the Arabian stallion's shining coat and the dramatically lit sky and ground in this finished drawing.

The still life also includes an onion, a turnip, a gherkin, a truffle, and a morel mushroom. Leafy plants peek out at the edges of a rocky ground evoking the earthen floor of a wood or glade.The termMachine d'Argent(literally,  silver machine ) was first assigned to this sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Oudry, who acted as intermediary between Franois-Thomas Germain and thepatron, Christian Ludwig II, Duke of Mecklenburg. In the 1700s, the wordmachinesignified an artistic innovation as well as a mechanicaldevice. Germain was specifically commissioned to create a decorative centerpiece to complement a series of paintings owned by the Duke that depicted exotic animals and scenes of the hunt. The sculpted game birds and rabbit represent trophies of the hunt. Combined with the root vegetables and mushrooms, the animals also alluded to the ingredients of a rich stew.Using a secret casting technique,Machine d'Argenttook seven months to create. Germain cast some of the still life elements from molds of dead animals or vegetables. These individual elements were then assembled together on the base. The rich variety of detail showcased Germain's ability to transform silver into the diverse textures of nature: from the soft fur of the rabbit and downy feathers of the ortolan to the multi-beaded head of cauliflower and the smooth, waxy skin of the onion bulb.","11 7 16 in.","Graphite","French","Horse Studies and Tassels","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13510401.jpg","Thodore Gricault","95.GD.40.6"

Later, Grme's pupil Charles Bargue included a lithograph after it in their influential teaching manual, Drawing Course (1866 - 1871).  The drawing depicted one of only two non-European subjects in the book. In contrast to the Romantic artists Gricault and Delacroix, Grme's approach seems dispassionate and documentary. Despite the apparent realism of his drawings, however, they are seldom objective records.

So wrote Jacques de Gheyn of his goals for his lavishly illustrated bookThe Exercise of Arms,published in 1607. In this preparatory drawing for the book, de Gheyn strove to create the illusion of a living soldier, carefully modeled in the round and exhibiting a wealth of detail both in costume and weaponry. Focusing on the intricate task of lighting the fuse of his musket, the soldier wears a large plumed hat, billowing striped pantaloons, and high boots, with powder charges strung across his breast. De Gheyn used a simple but imposing pose to create interest, with long, diagonal lines created by the soldier's musket, his sword, and the intersecting angle of his musket rest.Conceived as a military handbook for the infantry,Exercise of Armscontained one hundred and seventeen designs illustrating the use of the smallshot, the musket, and the pike. Count Johann II of Nassau-Siegen commissioned the text to give the Dutch army a set of clear and systematic military procedures for training soldiers.

His features seem more realistic, more like a portrait than the other, obviously imaginary figures, and his position squarely facing the viewer also isolates him. The care with which Jacques de Gheyn II rendered the boy's fanciful costume also contrasts with the other heads. Paying close attention to the fall of light, de Gheyn evoked the textures of the youth's clothing--especially the turban--with beautiful, varied penwork that demonstrates the creases and gathers. He built up the other heads using rather somewhat more regular cross-hatching.De Gheyn first sketched the three foreground figures of the young boy and two men, then later added the angel and the female head. He seems to have been one of the first artists to mingle figures drawn from nature with those from his imagination.

"1812 - 1814","At first glance, this drawing of a frog appears to be a closely observed study of the natural world. Jacques de Gheyn II meticulously recorded the amphibian's long hind legs and loose skin. But on closer inspection the frog was clearly imbued with human characteristics. Its webbed feet were transformed into claw-like hands and the exaggerated hump on its back evokes a grotesque old man. With its raised head and prominent eye, the frog even appears to hold an impassive, almost haughty expression. De Gheyn pushed the boundaries of the natural world further: the frog sits atop a pile of coins and with its left  hand  grasps a sphere about the same size as its twisted trunk.Somewhere between a realistic rendering of nature and an imaginative fantasy, the frog is an allegory of avarice. The creature does not merely rest on the coins but reaches greedily and uncouthly between its legs to grasp at them. The large sphere may symbolize the earth and the frog all the world's greed. Appropriate to the sin of avarice, the humanized frog is itself a monstrous perversion of the natural world.Fascinated by nature, De Gheyn created a large number of allegorical and anatomical drawings of amphibians, mice and rats, horses and donkeys, and insects. This small study was probably part of a much larger sheet covered with other fantastical images. Collectors considered such sheets marvels of virtuosity and imaginative power.","7 13 16 x 5 9 16 in.","Graphite","French","Cavalry Skirmish","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13511101.jpg","Thodore Gricault","95.GD.40.13"

Using a wide variety of thick and thin pen lines, dots, dashes, and calligraphic hatching, De Gheyn conveyed the textural effects of the sitter's hair and rough, aged skin.

He contrasted the elegant contours of her smooth, attenuated body and characteristically expressionless face with her intricately carved,classicizingcoiffure, drapery, and armband.X-rayanalysis has revealed a network of apparently interconnecting channels running from her raised left hand down to the base of the column upon which she sits, which suggests that the figure may once have served as a fountain.Marble works by Giambologna are very rare, but contemporary documents discuss a statue that scholars identify with this one. In 1568 the biographer Giorgio Vasari mentioned a statue of a nude woman that Giambologna made for Bernardo Vecchietti in Florence; another biographer reported that the work was later sent to the Duke of Bavaria.","8 x 5 5 8 in.","Graphite","French","Six Studies for Man beside a Rearing Horse","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13511401.jpg","Thodore Gricault","95.GD.40.16"

Although the piece has a principal frontal view, the animals yield a variety of different views as a spectator walks around the sculpture. The artist endowed the work with vivid details: the graphically rendered skin pulled by the lion's claws, the taut muscles of the bull's legs, and the longer hair on the top of the bull's head, carefully distinguished from the shorter fur around his flared nostrils.After Giambologna sculpted the model, Antonio and or Giovanni Francesco Susini's bronzefoundrycast the sculpture.

In the book, Gabriel Huquier'sThtre italien, the scene is identified as  Arlequin grapignant,  or  Harlequin as Procurer. The drawing is characteristic ofcommedia dell'arte'stendency to satirize human folly and pretense.

Yet the painting, using jewel-like yellow, purple, blue, and pinkpigmentsandgilding, brings out a spirited delicacy more typical of theRococostyle of the mid-1700s. As a result, Medusa, whose horrifying look was reputed to turn men to stone, is merely a rather startlingly rosy-cheeked woman with snakes for hair, while Argus, the hundred-eyed giant who tormented Jupiter's lover Io, is a handsome, muscled warrior.Each figural group is made from ten separate sections, each of which was press-molded and fired before being joined together. The figures are joined to Rococo bases with candle sockets, indicating that they were meant to function as part of a candelabrum. The two lively groups would have been a dramatic centerpiece for a dinner-table setting.The group was painted in the shop of Johann Karl Wendelin Anreiter von Zirnfeld.","7 15 16 x 5 3 4 in.","Graphite","French","Landscape with a Row of Trees","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13511901.jpg","Thodore Gricault","95.GD.40.21"

A sense of serenity and calm pervades this depiction of the Pentecost.Although only eight inches tall, this miniature has an impressive monumentality. The illuminator Girolamo da Cremona used the compositional and mathematical principles employed by fifteenth-century painters who worked on a larger scale. The miniature is symmetrically organized around the clear central axis of the Virgin and the dove: windows flank the dove, an equal number of apostles kneel in parallel rows, and candlesticks and books on the mantelpiece frame the Virgin. To relieve the monotony of the strict symmetry, the artist varied details such as the colors of the apostles' robes, the men's gestures, and the arrangement of books around the candles. Similarly, an open window opposes a closed one.The Pentecost miniature was made for a liturgical book or a book of private devotion.

This technique is a variation ofclich-verre(literally,  glass negative ), a method of painting onto a transparent support and using it to print a positive image. Instead of starting with a blank piece of glass, Giroux worked directly on the photographic negative.

Although the central scenes showing the escapades of Don Quixote and his companion Sancho remained the same, the surrounding decoration, known as thealentours,changed to reflect current fashions. The Getty Museum's tapestries come from the eighth weaving, which used the newly invented rose- and crimson-colored ground.The French kings often gave tapestries as diplomatic gifts.

Unlike many surviving hangings from the 1700s, these four tapestries remain in superb condition. The colors of all four scenes have faded very little overall, and some colors are still strong, particularly the shades of purple in thealentours,which usually fade to gray upon exposure to light.The surrounds for these tapestries were designed by Jean-Baptiste Belin de Fontenay, fils, Claude Audran III, Alexandre Franois Desportes, and Maurice Jacques.

John William Godward painted many scenes like this one of idealized beauties in calm, often sterile environments. In this painting, the figure of Repose is arranged seductively, with her breast and nipple showing through the thin material of her dress. But there is something distinctly untouchable about these women; they do not engage the viewer with an inviting gaze nor solicit personal contact.

The seascape in thebackground, the young woman's gesture, and her diaphanous gown, slightly rippling like a flag, all suggest an awaited signal from her beloved.Though rendering the scene so prettily as to nullify any true anxiety, John William Godward did tap into a universal feeling, the isolation experienced in the midst of uncertainty.

Here he took up Lucas van Leyden's manner, particularly in the flowing hatching of the fur collar and the rounded modeling of the fingers. Goltzius also gave pronounced emphasis to feathers, hair, and fur, aspects of his drawing that epitomized the styles of past Northern European masters.

Known for her dissolute lifestyle, the Marquesa died at the age of forty-three, three years after this portrait was made. An English visitor to Spain once described her as  very profligate and loose in her manners and conversations, and scarcely admitted into female societyand said to boast of her nocturnal revels. While contemporary portraitists sought to convey ideal beauty with a highly finished technique, Goya used a more expressionistic handling of the paint. Broad, quick brushstrokes describe her dark dress, and the application of thick impasto suggests the gold braid on the Marquesa's sleeve and lace of her mantilla. In the background, crude cottages and trees are merely indicated with wide, rapid sweeps of the brush.","15 1 4 x 13 1 4 in.","Silver","Flemish","Pair of Tureens, Liners, and Stands","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00658501.jpg","Franois-Thomas Germain","71.DG.78"

This young woman, however, wears a fine dress, jewelry, and a rather coy hairstyle and displays a graceful, almost cultivated bearing. She is pretty, not vacuous, but her questioning gaze and awkward cradling of the jug betray her uncertainty. Goya's caption, the drawing's title, tells the whole story: He admonishes her for playing at being a peasant, a practice then fashionable among the upper classes. Even as he rebuked this young woman, he flattered her, setting her alone and off-center on the sheet with a few pen strokes and a bit of wash to give her grounding. At least seventy years old when he made this drawing, Goya remained fluid and spontaneous in his technique, quickly capturing the swaying of her skirt and the little crinkles in her sleeve.","8 5 8 x 7 1 4 in.","Silver","Flemish","Tray","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00613101.jpg","Franois-Thomas Germain","2005.43"
"1852 - 1854","A sculptor chisels away at his statue of an ideal woman. Francisco Jos Goya y Lucientes here referred to the mythological story of Pygmalion, the legendary king of Cyprus who fell in love with a statue. According to Ovid, Pygmalion carved the statue from ivory with wonderful artistry. Every night he prayed to Venus that he might have a wife as beautiful as the image he had created. Finally, the goddess caused the statue to come to life. As Pygmalion's wife, she came to be called Galatea.In a possible self-portrait, Goya depicted Pygmalion with his legs spread wide, readying himself to take a mighty swing at the chisel, which is aimed at Galatea's crotch. Leaning slightly forward, she looks out with a fearful expression. Goya's animated interpretation of the well-known myth is highly original and even mocking.

The title inscribed below the image,Despreciar los ynsultos(Despise the insults), seems to signify Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes's defiance toward the French military occupation of Spain. The difference of scale between the tall, patronizing Spaniard and his squat, gloomy oppressors reinforces the point.Often politically motivated, Goya's art presented private exploits and tragedies with both satire and an awareness of the human condition that made his observations timeless and universal. He began to use the more intimate mediums of drawings and prints for his purposeful and serious satires after 1792. Goya made this sketch, sixteenth of about fifty drawings in the  Black Border  album, for his own amusement and interest rather than for sale or other purposes.","11 1 2 x 15 3 8 in.","Gilt bronze","Dutch","Four Wall Lights (Two Pairs)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00657601.jpg","Jean-Lon Grme","85.PA.226"

Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes made the drawing at age sixty and had himself survived a serious illness; along with several other studies of old people, he included this drawing in his now-dispersed  Album D. For Goya, the paper played as strong a role as brush and india ink. He enhanced the old man's sense of isolation by placing him low on the page, allowing the blank background to suggest his loneliness. Blank paper evokes his bald head, and the india ink provided clean black strokes and exceptionally fine gray washes for the high dramatic contrasts Goya valued. Few of his more than a thousand known drawings are purely linear, fitting for the artist who first declared that nature contains no lines.","10 x 14 13 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Dutch","The Age of Augustus, the Birth of Christ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00088601.jpg","Jean-Lon Grme","2010.16"

The bull coolly eyes his opponent as a group of fearful men try to distract the savage animal.Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes painted this work late in his career when he had begun experimenting with different techniques. Showing remarkable freedom, Goya used a heavily loaded brush, a palette knife, a rag, and even his fingers to apply paint to the canvas.

This drawing comes from  Album G,  one of the two albums Francisco Jos de Goya y Lucientes compiled when he was living in Bordeaux at the end of his life. Many of the sheets from the series show Goya's interest in representing people on the fringes of society.

The water, nearly glass-smooth, reflects clouds, castle and boats gliding across it. A coach-and-four with red-coated coachman and passengers skates across on a ferry, lobster fishermen draw up their net, and cows complacently drink in the tranquility. A restrainedpaletteof blue, silvery gray, and pale green envelops the castle of Wijk, making it seem more a fairy-tale place than an actual building near Duurstede, a town southeast of Utrecht where the Rhine forks.Van Goyen consistently showed skill in rendering nearly monochrome landscapes and recording the subtly shifting tonal effects of the moist Dutch air. This painting exemplifies a new phase of Dutch landscape painting established about 1630, which was distinguished by modest, domestic subject matter, a low vantage point, and a palette limited in color but richly varied in tone.","87 1 2 x 68 5 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and graywash, incised for transfer","Italian","Design for a Title Page","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00033401.jpg","Jacques de Gheyn II","88.GA.134"

On a raised platform in front of it, three musicians play the fiddle and tambourine while townsfolk sit and listen. A covered carriage draws up to the scene, and a couple greets the new arrivals. In the center of the field, two other stalls provide shelter for those selling their wares.Van Goyen took full advantage of the diverse action to create a lively and entertainingcomposition. Peasant sellers and elegant and ordinary shoppers alike discuss and examine the varied goods for sale. Using fluid strokes, van Goyen suggested people's faces with circles and the outlines of buildings, animals, and foliage with rapid, vivid lines.Van Goyen frequently traveled about the Netherlands as a picture dealer, valuer, and speculator in tulip bulbs, land, and houses. Based on the sights he had seen on his trips, he made many elaborate drawings like this one in his studio.","121 5 8 x 44 7 8 in.","Pen and brown ink on light brown fibrous paper","Italian","Bust of a Boy in a Turban, a Winged Angel, and Three Old Men","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00026501.jpg","Jacques de Gheyn II","2003.23"

Their forms merge at the top and widen to form a pyramid that emphasizes their lower bodies, muscular legs, and wide feet, conveying a powerful sense of energy. Graf's swift, incisive penwork emphasizes the then-commonplace notion that peasants were symbols of the cycles of nature: earthy, fertile, full of vital strength--and often bawdy.Someone extensively pricked the drawing with holes that follow the outline of the figures and the back has been rubbed with black chalk. Scholars once thought that this pricking indicated that such drawings had been made as designs for prints, with the image transferred onto another surface by rubbing chalk dust through the holes.

"1571 - 1573","One of the rounded arches in the tomb of the French King Louis-Philippe forms the dark frame of this scene, drawing the viewer's eye into the lighter interior beyond. The strong perspectival grid of the floor tiles anchors the scene, while the repeating patterns of the arches above and the large tombs of the Orlans family in the side alcove create another design. In contrast to the massive architectural forms, the priests, choir boys, and female parishioners who kneel in prayer seem small and insignificant.Franois-Marius Granet specialized in scenes where the changing patterns of light became the focus of dimly lit interiors. In one of his few works to be completed in pen and ink alone, Granet further emphasized the strong effects of light and dark by using hatching and cross-hatching. He delighted in exploring the visual impact of varied, dense lines, suggesting textures and surfaces with numerous delicate strokes.","6 x 4 3 8 in.","Pen and brown ink","French","Head of an Old Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 24173601.jpg","Pier Leone Ghezzi","2003.8"
"1600 - 1625","The kicking horse twists his head back as if to be sure he is aiming correctly at the attacking lion or boar, now lost, that originally formed part of the sculpture. His tail swirls in the air while he pricks up his ears and furrows his brow. These expressive details of the horse, caught in action, add to the sense of intense struggle. The artist Caspar Gras's  interest in dramatic moments and spontaneous movement is characteristic of the Baroque style.Possibly one of the earliest known Baroque bronze horses shown kicking both rear feet in the air, this sculpture's creation was made possible by new technical advances. Beginning about 1600, thinner, lighter casts allowed sculptors to balance the metal's weight on only two points. Sculptors also perfected the technique of casting bronze figures in parts, allowing for compositions with many projecting, separately cast elements.","H:  3 3 8 x Diam.:  2 7 16 in.","Black chalk, pen, and brown ink","Italian","Portraits of Serafino and Francesco Falzacappa","www.getty.edu art collections images l 24183001.jpg","Giambologna","82.SA.37"

In drawn studies such as this one, he departed from the high drama of his paintings and captured his sitter's individual character with sympathy and humility. A consummate draftsman, Greuze made many vivid, expressive, large-scale head studies in chalk, which he did not necessarily intend for specific paintings; sometimes they were later engraved and distributed as prints.This drawing may be a study for the old man seated at the right of the paintingL'Aveugle trompin Moscow's Pushkin Museum.","2 ft. 2 5 8 in. x 1 ft. 9 5 8 in. x 1 ft. 1 11 16 in.","Bronze","Italian","Lion Attacking a Bull","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00146301.jpg","Felice Giani","92.GG.17"

In a room scattered with wet and drying laundry, a disheveled maidservant with an exposed stocking and slipper fixes the viewer with a provocative gaze.Greuze used a heavily loaded brush to apply patches of paint that describe texture and surface: the folds of the young woman's dress, the heaviness of wet cloth, the dull sheen on the pewter jug, and the grainy texture of wood.","14 15 16 x 42 3 16 in.","Pen and brown ink, and watercolor over black chalk","Italian","Allegory on the Life of Canova","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00038101.jpg","Claude Gillot","84.GA.66"

In hisMemorable Acts and Sayings of the Ancient Romans, the ancient Roman historian Valerius Maximus, Pero's selfless devotion was presented as the highest example of honoring one's parent.In the 1600s, major artists painted dramatic versions of the popular subject, which Jean-Baptiste Greuze and other artists revived a century later. Closely basing the setting and arrangement of figures on Peter Paul Rubens's version, Greuze probably made this oil sketch as the final stage of preparation for an unexecuted, large-scale painting. Contemporaries admired the rapid execution, vibrant colors, and lively paint handling in Greuze's oil sketches. The criticDenis Diderotlavishly praised his combination ofgenreandhistory paintingand his public, moralizing purpose.","9 3 4 x 8 7 16 in.","Pen and black ink and reddish wash (recto); pen and black ink (verso)","Italian","Scene from the Italian Comedy (recto); Figure Study (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00008201.jpg","Ginori Porcelain Factory","94.SE.76"

Here he only quickly indicated the woman's cap and hood, concentrating his attention on the emotional and expressive qualities of her haggard face with its furrowed brow, penetrating eyes, and parted lips.Greuze made this drawing as a preparatory study for the figure of a woman kneeling at her husband's bedside in one of his best-known paintings,La Dame de Charit, completed in 1775 at the height of his career. Greuze's narrative paintings were highly theatrical, with facial expression and gesture conveying the story.

Jean-Baptiste Greuze portrayed the mother and daughter in fine clothing to emphasize the disparity between their lives and that of the impoverished couple, whose only valuable possession, a sword, is prominently displayed behind them. Greuze was famous for moralizing images like this one, which were meant to illustrate the importance of good deeds and childhood instruction in a domestic setting. InThe Charitable Woman,a complex scene that explores a wide range of human expression, he used spontaneous applications of wash to intensify the sense of drama.Greuze producedThe Charitable Womanas a compositional study for a painting of the same name,now in the Muse des Beaux-Arts, Lyon. Prior to making this drawing, he made numerous studies of individual figures, such as theStudy of the Head of an Old Woman,who is one of the principal characters in this scene.

"1469","Seemingly unaware of the activity all around him, a youth supine is the focus of gods; some tease and tempt him with pleasurable offerings, while others guide him toward prudence.  Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, grasps his left hand urging him toward virtuous restraint. The god of wine, Bacchus, pours wine onto the young man to arouse his desires. Cupid, the tiny child-god of love, directs the youth's face toward his mother Venus who presses her right breast, emblematic of sybaritic pleasures.The entire surface of the vessel is carved and showcases the technical virtuosity of its maker, Balthasar Griessmann. This ivory specialist skillfully moved between different degrees of relief: from figures fully sculpted in three-dimensions to extremely shallow passages. Floral Bacchic motifs cover the lid, base, and stem of the vessel. Putti bearing fruit-laden garlands cavort around the lid, which is surmounted at the pinnacle with a single putto brandishing a cup in one hand and a bunch of grapes in the other. At the base lie recumbent drunken putti and satyrs.Griessmann faithfully derived the goblet's composition from a work by Otto van Veen,Allegory of the Temptations of Youth, known to the carver from a print by Antwerp artist Pieter Perret. Griessmann cunningly puts the allegory in the hands of the imbiber, who--like the youth--should consider the balance of indulgence with moderation. The virtuosity of the piece is such that it was most likely displayed at courtly banquets--a showpiece, to be viewed and admired, rather than utilized.","16 1 2 x 19 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, andgold leafonparchment","French","Initial D: The Virgin and Child","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00410401.jpg","Guglielmo Giraldi","4 1 4 x 3 1 8 in."

Sculptor Alessandro Algardi added the figures after painter Francesco Grimaldi had created the landscape. By inserting the Holy Family, which fits so naturally into the composition, the elder Algardi may have meant to improve his junior colleague's composition. The figural group balances the central tree and gives the landscape a recognizable subject matter. To achieve greaterluster, Algardi also may have added the brownwashthroughout.The artists' styles are distinctive. Algardi drew his playful family grouping with a more delicate, graceful, even fragile line than Grimaldi's bold squiggles and hatching, which are especially evident in the dynamic, dominant tree.These two artists often worked together on architectural commissions, yet only one other similar sheet exists, an architectural drawing in which Algardi corrected and added to Grimaldi's work.

Five weeks later, the director of the Muse Napoleon announced a competition for the commission to paint the Emperor on the battlefield the day after the actual fighting. The director ordered the artists to show the Emperor surveying the battlefield and directing his troops to assist the wounded. A specific story was to be included, involving a wounded Lithuanian soldier who offered his allegiance to the Emperor if he would heal him.Scholars believe this drawing was made by Antoine-Jean Gros as apreliminary studyfor an oil sketch that eventually won him the commission for the final painting, now in theMuse du Louvre. The artist quickly and loosely sketched his early ideas in pencil first and then drew over the outlines in thick black ink. He placed the Emperor Napoleon in the center of the scene, riding among the wounded and dying. The wounded Lithuanian soldier reaches up to attract Napoleon's attention as he approaches. This compositional sketch concentrates on the figures' positions and gestures rather than details of costume and facial expressions.","5 1 8 to 5 5 16 x 7 11 16 to 7 13 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold paint, gold leaf, and ink on parchment","French","Saint Ossanus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00412401.jpg","Franois Girardon","88.SB.73"

On the right, a few early-risers mill about on the banks of the canal.Francesco Guardi often paintedvedute,or views, of Venice's principal waterway. Many of the buildings in this view were palaces of important Venetian families. The most prominent among them is the two-toned Palazzo Bembo on the canal's left bank. Its owners, and Guardi's likelypatrons, even appear on the palace's upper balcony.Guardi appreciated Venice as a city of constant change rather than as a static tourist destination. On the right side, behind the tiny figures on shore, he depicted the Church of San Geremia in the midst of its renovation.

He paid great attention to delineating the intricate colonnades along the facades of the palaces on the right. The buildings on the left are more varied in type and height, penetrated here and there with windows and arcades, their chimneys rising into the expanse of sky.Across the square, loosely drawn couples stop to chat in the sunshine, bend to examine something on the ground, or walk hand-in-hand.

The fluency of the wash combined with the energy of his handling conveys a sense of luminosity, while the startlingchiaroscuroeffects typify Guardi's approach to light and shadow.

Artists usually made such drawings from the nude, known asacadmies, in an art academy or in an artist's studio. Guercino probably made large-scale drawings like this one as demonstration pieces to inspire the pupils in his own academy. He made other oiled-charcoal nude studies of this model around the same time. For these studies, Guercino typically used rough, light-brown paper and charcoal soaked in oil, which made the line darker and more permanent. For luminosity, he added occasional touches of white chalk highlights. This combination enabled him to create luminous shadows or reflected light within deep shadow and to suggest the texture of flesh. His masterly technique simplified forms and distinctively modeled them with soft lines and broad shading to suggest the play of light.","13 15 16 x 6 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Cond Nast","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06097701.jpg","Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory","92.DD.21"

Although Guercino rarely painted portraits, he used a composition that had become a standard for papal portraiture since the Renaissance. But Guercino placed less emphasis on the trappings of power than earlier papal portraits and more on his subject's character. This portrait shows a keen psychological understanding of his patron's state of mind, capturing the pope at the end of his life, worn out by the cares of office and failing health.","10 1 8 x 7 11 16 in.","Wool and silk","French","Tapestry: The Striped Horse from The Old Indies Series","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00696701.jpg","Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory","85.DD.309"

He filtered his acute observations of the people and events of everyday life through his sharp perception of the comic, a precedent established by his Bolognese predecessors the Carracci, and before them, Leonardo Da Vinci.Working quickly, Guercino caricatured two middle-aged men gazing intently to the left. He depicted their faces in the most detail, yet even here he used only a few, well-placed lines to suggest a jawline or a beard. He then delicately touched essential areas with luminous wash in varied intensities. In particular, the face of the man at far left shows Guercino's subtle accuracy with wash, suggesting the effects of sunlight on his skin. The men's clothing is treated even more subtly: a hasty criss-cross of tangled lines describe the arms of the man at the left, folded in his baggy sleeves.","18 7 8 x 14 3 16 x 5 1 16 in.","Silk and wool","French","Tapestry: Portire aux Armes de France","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00672901.jpg","Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory","82.DD.67"

Protecting herself from the sun, she holds a small blue parasol and wears a bonnet. Touches of white--her gloves, sleeves, and flowing scarf--offset her blue and purple ensemble. Between her billowy sleeves and her gloves, the woman displays golden jewelry. She demurely reaches down with her left hand to hold up her voluminous dress. This mass of material contrasts sharply with her small head and single foot peaking out from below.The woman's immense dress would have been supported by an elaborate structure of crinolines or stiffened petticoats. Constantin Guys produced this drawing at the height of fashion for crinolines and full skirts. To suggest many layers of thin fabric, Guys built up layer upon layer of wash and repeating triangles drawn in ink. Guys' attention to contemporary fashion and make-up made him Charles Baudelaire's quintessential painter of modern life. But Baudelaire championed  Monsieur G  not merely for conveying appearances and artifice. For Baudelaire, Guys' watercolors and drawings not only captured his subjects in the present moment, but also imbued them with a look of timelessness, elevating them to the status of historical figures.","21 x 17 5 16 in.","Silk and wool","English","Tapestry: Sancho's Cowardice during the Hunt, from The Story of Don Quixote Series","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00661001.jpg","Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory","82.DD.66"

"1525","On this preserved section of recomposed fragments of a large drinking cup-or skyphos--a man balances himself on his right foot as he lifts his left leg and drinks from a large white cup. Individual figures in amusing poses were often used to decorate red-figured drinking cups destined for use in the symposion. But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it. It features white, red, and orange designs painted atop of a black-gloss ground, and often includes delicately incised silhouette. The technique was invented around the same time as thered-figure technique, in approximately 525 B.C.  Both feature a light-on-dark appearance that contrasts with the dark-on-light effect of the olderblack-figure technique.","8 x 7 1 2 in.","Oil on panel","American","View of the Castle of Wijk at Duurstede","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00075501.jpg","Jan van Goyen","85.GG.296"

Faint traces of a headrest, an apparatus used to restrict a sitter's movement, indicate that the negative was changed to mask this tool. They also altered the original negative for this image to include a specific reference to the Rev. James Julius Wood's position: the titleScotch Church Malta 1843drawn in ink on the book he holds. Wood was chaplain to the 42nd Gordon Highlanders, a group of soldiers stationed on the Mediterranean island of Malta.Hill used thiscalotypeas the basis for Wood's portrait inThe Disruption Picture, even though the minister may not have been present at the signing ceremony.

Arguably the first examples of social documentary photographs ever made, these approximately 130 images dealt with everyday life.

"1767","Having learned to make photographs directly from William Henry Fox Talbot, the inventor of thecalotypeprocess, the eminent scientist Sir David Brewster brought photography to Scotland in the early 1840s, making the country one of the early experimental centers for the new art. In a July 3, 1843, letter to Talbot, Brewster wrote:I got hold of the artist[David Octavius Hill]--showed him the Calotype, & the eminent advantage he might derive from it in getting likenesses of all the principal characters before they were dispersed to their respective homes. He was at first incredulous, but went to Mr.[Robert]Adamson, and arranged with him preliminaries for getting all the necessary portraits.Seeing the opportunity for photography to assist in the process of making preliminary studies for painting, Brewster introduced Hill to Adamson, who had recently opened a photographic studio in Edinburgh. Brewster himself was a member of the newly formed Free Church of Scotland. Using this calotype as a model, Hill included Brewster's portrait inThe Disruption Picture.","1 ft. 5 3 4 in. x 11 5 8 in. x 8 9 16 in.","Red chalk","German","Study of the Head of an Old Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00008301.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Greuze","83.PA.387"
"1772 - 1775","David Hill and Robert Adamson often photographed Elizabeth Rigby, later Lady Eastlake, along with her mother and sister while the three women were living in Edinburgh. In 1849 Elizabeth married Sir Charles Eastlake, president of the Royal Academy, Director of the National Gallery, and first President of the Royal Photographic Society. She became an author and critic, and in 1857 she published a groundbreaking article,  Photography,  one of the first histories of the medium that also championed photography as a fine art. Eastlake wrote:  It is now more than fifteen years ago that specimens of a new and mysterious art were first exhibited to our wondering gaze...we examined them with the keenest admiration, and felt that the spirit of Rembrandt had revived. Lady Eastlake is shown here seated in a doorway, which provides a frame for the contrast between the darkness inside and the outdoor light into which the sitter faces. Her eyes are cast downward and appear almost melancholy, but the lyrical gesture may not have a poetic intent. Eastlake probably averted her eyes from the camera because the exposure time for the photograph would have been up to thirty seconds, too long for her eyes to remain focused.","12 13 16 x 9 5 16 in.","Oil on canvas","German","The Laundress (La Blanchisseuse)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00084301.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Greuze","99.PA.24"

In this image he stands against the doorway of Rock House, perfectly at ease and well-composed. I know not the process though it is done under my nose continually and I believe I never will,  wrote painter David Octavius Hill of the photographic medium. Hill clearly saw his role in the partnership as providing artistic direction.

Working for the National Child Labor Committee, Hine made thousands of pictures of children at work--in Southern mills, glass factories, fish canneries, tenements, and fields. He recorded their names, their heights, the hours they worked, the money they spent, and such descriptive details as  out past midnight  or  smokes cigars.

"1852 - 1857","Oltos was an important vase painter specializing in the decoration of bilingual andred-figurecups. He painted both theblack-figureand the red-figure decoration of his bilinguals. Like most of his late bilingual eye-cups, this black-figure tondo bears the inscription,  Memnon is beautiful. The figure painted in the tondo has no distinguishing attributes to aid identification. He is nude, except for a mantle thrown over his left shoulder and right arm. Touches of added red, an old-fashionedmotifused in black-figure and characteristic of Oltos, embellish alternate folds of the mantle, as well as sections of the man's hair and beard. Like the figure in the tondo, the red-figured youth on the exterior of the cup is anonymous, in his case entirely nude except for a purplish added-red wreath around his head.Bilingual vases were developed as a style of vase decoration in Athens around 525 B.C. They combine the two traditional Athenian vase-decoration techniques: the older technique of black-figure, and red-figure, the technique that would gain popularity and continue to be used through the fourth century B.C. On a black-figure vase, silhouettes in black gloss are contrasted against the red-orange clay of the vessel. On a red-figure vase, the forms come from the red-orange color of the clay, and the space around them is filled in with black gloss. Like most bilingual cups, this is an eye-cup, with large eyes painted on the red-figured exterior and a single black figure on the tondo of the interior. Red-figuredpalmettesappear at the handles, and a single red figure occupies the space between the large eyes on one side.","6 ft. 3 1 2 in. x 2 ft. 1 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 11 1 2 in.","Pen and brown ink with light brown wash","American","Caricature of Two Men Seen in Profile","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00044501.jpg","Giovanni di Ser Giovanni Guidi","71.PB.43"

Powerful oak trees dominate the composition, casting the foreground into shadow, while a sun-drenched clearing in the distance draws the viewer into the scene.In addition to the winding roads and animated figures, artist Meindert Hobbema, used thick applications of paint in combination with thin delineating brushstrokes to create a sense of energy and motion throughout the landscape. The lively, inventive view of nature and brooding palette of deep browns and grays in this painting are characteristic of Hobbema's landscapes; however, few of them are as cleverly organized and grandly executed as this wooded view.","30 1 4 x 39 3 4 in.","Temperaon panel","American","Battle Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00065701.jpg","Jeremiah Gurney","84.XT.1564.20"

"1984","'Pearblossom Highway' shows a crossroads in a very wide open space, which you only get a sense of in the western United States. . . . [The] picture was not just about a crossroads, but about us driving around. I'd had three days of driving and being the passenger. The driver and the passenger see the road in different ways. When you drive you read all the road signs, but when you're the passenger, you don't, you can decide to look where you want. And the picture dealt with that: on the right-hand side of the road it's as if you're the driver, reading traffic signs to tell you what to do and so on, and on the left-hand side it's as if you're a passenger going along the road more slowly, looking all around. So the picture is about driving without the car being in it.Thus David Hockney described the circumstances leading to the creation of this photocollage of the scenic Pearblossom Highway north of Los Angeles. His detailed collage reveals the more mundane observations of a road trip. The littered cans and bottles and the meandering line where the pavement ends and the sand begins point to the interruption of the desert landscape by the roads cutting through it and the imprint of careless travelers.","12 1 2 x 17 13 16 in.","Gravure half-tone print","American","The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.

For me, it was a long process realizing that this does not have to be the case.When making his two photocollages of Pearblossom Highway, David Hockney positioned himself closer to or more distant from his subjects, choosing which elements in the scene should be large and which should be small. By reassembling views from multiple perspectives, he applied ideas borrowed from Cubist painting to produce a rich, compound image that he considers  a panoramic assault on Renaissance one-point perspective. Hockney made this work as a preparatory study for the final version,Pearblossom Hwy., 11 -  18th April 1986, #2,which measures approximately six-and-a-half by nine feet. Aside from scale, the principal differences between the two versions are the distortion of the stop sign in the foreground and the left and right edges of the composition.","26 3 16 x 20 in.","Chromogenic print","American","Abelino's Mother's House, Las Vegas, New Mexico","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13411501.jpg","Alex Harris","98.XM.214.10"
"1985","In the 1500s, as printing became the most common method of producing books, intellectuals increasingly valued the inventiveness of scribes and the aesthetic qualities of writing. From 1561 to 1562, Georg Bocskay, the Croatian-born court secretary to the Holy RomanEmperor Ferdinand I, created thisModel Book of Calligraphyin Vienna to demonstrate his technical mastery of the immense range of writing styles known to him.About thirty years later, Emperor Rudolph II, Ferdinand's grandson, commissioned Joris Hoefnagel to illuminate Bocskay's model book.  Hoefnagel added fruit, flowers, and insects to nearly every page, composing them so as to enhance the unity and balance of the page's design. It was one of the most unusual collaborations between scribe and painter in the history ofmanuscriptillumination.Because of Hoefnagel's interest in painting objects of nature, his detailed images complement Rudolph II's celebratedKunstkammer,a cabinet of curiosities that contained bones, shells, fossils, and other natural specimens. Hoefnagel's careful images of nature also influenced the development of Netherlandish still life painting.In addition to his fruit and flower illuminations, Hoefnagel added to theModel Booka section on constructing the letters of the alphabet in upper- and lowercase.","20 1 8 x 24 3 4 in.","Chromogenic print","American","Las Trampas, New Mexico","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13412401.jpg","Alex Harris","98.XM.214.3"

On this page Bocskay presented a Latin prayer, beginningDeus(God), employing an elaborate angular script, gold filler for the last line, and ornate flourishes above and below the text.Thirty years later, when illuminator Joris Hoefnagel painted the blank space left at the bottom of the page, he carefully coordinated his image with the script already on the page. Hoefnagel painted a pear, caterpillar, centipede, and hover fly in colors that harmonize with those of the text. The contrast between the yellow and ochre of the moth, hover fly, and pear and the black of the caterpillar echoes the contrast between the gold used for the initial and the decorative filler and the black ink used for the majority of the text. The hover fly was inspired by Bocskay's lower flourishes, which suggest the trajectory of a fly.","24 x 35 3 8 in.","Chromogenic print","American","Amadeo Sandoval's Kitchen and Bedroom, Ro Luco, New Mexico","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13411701.jpg","Alex Harris","98.XM.214.4"

To preserve Bocskay's calligraphic flourish, Hoefnagel painted the flower so as to suggest that the stem pierced the page. The illuminator, who can create an illusion of three-dimensionality, asserted the virtuosity of his art in contrast to that of the calligrapher, whose lines never disturb the two-dimensionality of the page.Hoefnagel painted his objects with a microscopic detail that invites the viewer to look closely at these rare and exotic items, but his illustrations were not always strictly accurate.

While the dragonfly appears to be laid out like a stiff scientific specimen, Hoefnagel imbued the imaginary insect on the right with life and movement as it gently alights on the carnation.

"1594","In the late 1400s, northern European artists began to study and draw plants and animals with a greater interest in accuracy. Although showing the uniqueness of each of these specimens was undoubtedly important to Hans Hoffmann, he equally tried to portray the individual beauty of each flower and insect. He placed the peony, two species of irises, an amaryllis, a may beetle, and a june bug in an attractive arrangement on the page. He drew the delicate forms carefully and added lush color in a palette of green, blue, and red. He used plain black chalk to represent the shadow cast by the beetle's body, illusionistically raising the beetle's legs off the ground with this trompe-l'oeil effect.Hoffmann may have intended this arrangement of nature studies to be hung as a painting, since it was listed as such in the archives of its original owner and it remained in a frame until well into the 1800s. Scholars consider this one of the first examples of still life painting.","57 1 2 x 46 1 2 in.","Collage of inkjet digital mounted to wood with polyurethane foam","American","Octopus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 28271801.jpg","Marcus Heiden","91.DH.75"
"1650 - 1660","Nibbling on a leaf pulled from a stalk of Lady's Mantle, an alert hare sits at the edge of a pine forest. Unlike the darkness one would expect to find in a forest, Hans Hoffmann painted a theatrically illuminated scene. Each plant and insect--snail, cricket, beetle--is seen in vivid detail. The finely wrought leaves of the thistle, the sprawling fronds of a plantain, and the bright blue flowers of the Hare Bell attest to Hoffmann's meticulous treatment of the subject. In fact, none of these plants could have co-existed in the natural world. Hoffmann imaginatively combined numerous individual nature studies in a single painting.Hoffmann's golden-brown hare is based on Albrecht Drer's famous and influential watercolor which, much like hisStag Beetle, shows a hare against a plain ground. Hoffmann had seen Drer's hare while in Nuremburg. Later, when he went to work in the court of Emperor Rudolf II, he helped the Emperor acquire the watercolor for hisKunstkammer. Hoffmann's hare differs from Drer's however, appearing amid a striking arrangement of elegant plants and insects. At the time it was painted, this arrangement of nearly life-size subjects was entirely unique, not only within Hoffmann's body of work, but also within the tradition of German nature study.","39 3 4 x 53 in.","Ivory","American","Stemmed Covered Cup","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00141901.jpg","Joseph Heintz the Elder","91.GB.66"

He used a pointed quill pen and ink to make the contour lines of the face and details such as the small dots that suggest the stubble of an incipient beard. In this second stage, Holbein made several changes in the outline of the hat and the cloak just behind the sitter's head. He used a soft red chalk over the pink ground of the paper to model the face subtly.Holbein became painter to the court of King Henry VIII of England in 1536. After the artist's death in 1543, numerous drawings of members of the court were found in his studio.

Presented as a sweet, intelligent child, Louise was about five when sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon carved this portrait for her father, an architect and friend of the artist. Avoiding the empty sentimentality common in representations of children in the 1700s, he captured Louise's intelligence and liveliness. The youth of the sitter and the artist'snaturalisticrendering lighten the formality of thebust, a format adopted fromantiquesculpture.

Brongniart, the French geologist and mineralogist who served as the director of the SvresPorcelainFactory from 1800 until his death in 1847, probably then commissioned the marble version.

Yet his sparkling eyes and the upturned corners of his lips, which hint at a smile, convey a warm disposition.To accurately render Bir's likeness, Houdon measured his head and face with calipers, and probably made a plaster  life mask  for reference. He probably modeled thebustfirst in clay, and then made aplaster cast. From those initial studies, Houdon would have produced this final marble version, which he gave to the sitter.

"1845","Saturn, one of the Titans who once ruled earth in Roman mythology, devours the infant child he holds in his arm. According to a prophecy, Saturn would be overthrown by one of his sons. In response, he ate his sons as soon as they were born. But the mother of his children, Rhea, hid one child, Zeus. Later, Zeus gave his father a potion, forcing him to regurgitate his siblings; he then vanquished his father and ruled over earth, fulfilling the prophecy. Saturn's cannibalism is graphically shown here: in his left hand he holds a bone from one of his already eaten children while he partially ingests the child in his arm.Simon Hurtrelle represented Saturn as a powerful, yet elderly figure with wings. The wings suggest the speed of time and derive from the association of Saturn, also known as Cronos, with the Greek god of time, Chronus. Similarly, Saturn's loss of hair indicates the passing of time. The composition of the bronze was inspired by an antique Roman marble sculpture that Hurtrelle saw in Rome.","15 3 8 x 20 1 4 in.","Salt print","American","Miss Elizabeth Rigby","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04631001.jpg","Hill & Adamson","84.XM.445.12"

Arranged in a terracotta vase displaying an antique relief, Jan van Huysum included flowers from all seasons of the year--roses, anemones, hyacinths, tulips, and more--and painted them directly from life. The flowers' nearly overripe quality attests both to nature's bounty and its transience. The bouquet is ordered in a loose pyramidal shape, with flowers and greenery almost bursting to be free of the vase. Butterflies and other insects fly or crawl amongst the arrangement, and drops of water are visible on leafs and shiny petals.Van Huysum painstakingly applied layer upon layer of thin oil glazes to capture the brilliant colors and delicate textures of the blossoms. Because each flower could only be painted while in season, it sometimes took the artist several years to complete a single painting.","H:  1 x Diam.:  9 1 16 in.","Albumen print","American","Little Bear, Cheyenne","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06719101.jpg","John K.

"1908","In what may be a companion piece to theVase of Flowers, Jan van Huysum combined the lustrous realism of seventeenth-century Dutch paintings with the bright colors characteristic of the eighteenth century in a lavish still life of fruit and flowers. The asymmetrical arrangement of bursting and overripe fruit spills over onto the ledge, some falling prey to insects. Flowers droop under the weight of their extravagant blooms. Van Huysum deftly rendered the translucence of the grapes, the crisp surfaces of the leaves, and the wiry texture of the vines.The highly finished surfaces of Van Huysum's paintings were the result of a laborious application of glazes to the canvas. He jealously guarded the details of this technique, allowing no visitors in his studio.","17 7 8 x 22 in.","Albumen print","American","Moki Girls","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04626701.jpg","Lewis Wickes Hine","84.XM.967.1"
"1909","Still life painting flourished in Holland in the 1600s. A great interest in botany arose toward the end of the 1500s, when collectors of herbs and plants were spending fortunes on their gardens; their desire for portraits of their prized possessions fueled the popularity of flower painting. Later on, Dutch still lifes were eagerly taken up by French painters and collectors and came to decorate the most fashionable Frenchsalons.Like Jan van Huysum himself, this follower of Huysum embraced many different species in his composition, including flowers that do not bloom in the same season. While Van Huysum usually intended his ephemeral blossoms to convey aVanitasmeditation on the fleetingness of life, this artist's purpose was probably largely decorative. As in its companionVase of Flowers,the flowers take up nearly the entire canvas, emphasizing the arrangement's abundance. The composition is straightforward, centrally placed against a blank background that sets off the colorful flowers and their Rococo vase.","17 x 12 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Self-Portrait with Newsboy","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06840101.jpg","Lewis Wickes Hine","4 5 8 x 6 9 16 in."

Working in the 1700s, Van Huysum acquired the sophisticated taste and love of embellishment associated with the Rococo period in France.

Here the infamous ancestor receives a hat and sword blessed by the pope for suppressingProtestantheresy in the Netherlands.

Despite reworking the picture into a red-dominatedcompositionsymbolizing a bloodbath, Ingres, repulsed, abandoned the painting in 1819. He later said that the painting remained a sketch- as God had wished.  Edgar Degas, a great admirer of Ingres, once owned the unfinished canvas.

In Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres's later painting, a smaller brooch seems insignificant, while a long string of pearls echoes the flowing sweep of the woman's shawl and provides a purpose for the hand at her waist. He made two additional studies of her left hand in the upper right corner, exploring how she might hold the shawl.In this preparatory study for an 1851 painting, Ingres concentrated on the woman's dress, her jewels, and the positions of her arms and hands. To determine the figure's proportions, he drew a grid or  squared  the drawing. He freely worked out new ideas from the bodice on down, probably tracing the head and shoulders from another study. Ingres made many such preparatory sketches for his four painted portraits of Ins Moitessier, a banker's wife from a prominent family of government officials.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Austrian","Empire State Building, New York","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06807601.jpg","Oltos","86.AE.276"

Even the tattoo is a highly coded element; it depicts Mexico's patron saint, the Virgin of Guadalupe--also calledLa Virgen Morena, or the brown-skinned Virgin. Some speculate that Mexico's indigenous Virgin of Guadalupe has roots in the Aztec mother goddess Tonantzin. The characteristic wavy, pointed tendrils that surround her evoke rays of holy light. However, these are also thought to refer to something organic, namely the spiked agave plant, which Mexicans ferment intopulque, mezcal, and tequila--alcoholic beverages enjoyed on the Virgin of Guadalupe's feast day.Like her mentor, Manuel Alvarez Bravo, Iturbide is known for photographs that explore the diversity of her native Mexico, especially its indigenous peoples.

Though he had already amassed an unrivaled collection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain, Augustus wanted these new figures to be produced by his own factory at Meissen. When Augustus placed the order for these porcelain animals, the Meissen factory was still of very limited experience, having only discovered the formula forhard-paste porcelainabout twenty years prior. The figure was modeled by Johan Joachim Kndler, a sculptor who was hired by the manufactory in 1731 to assist with the commission for the animalsProducing such large figures presented a number of challenges for Kndler and the Meissen craftsmen. The clay's thickness and weight and uneven shrinking frequently caused the animals to crack and collapse in the kiln. This turkey, along with all other sculptures for Augustus, was originally meant to be painted in the animal's natural colors; however, doing so proved technically impossible. Despite these difficulties, the figures stand as important examples of an early and experimental aspect of ceramic art.","10 1 16 x 13 15 16 in.","Hard-paste porcelain, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","Japanese","Wine Pot","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00676001.jpg","Meissen Porcelain Manufactory","85.SA.220"

"1722","One day in 1932, I was standing in front of the Acadmie Franaise and decided to take a look at what was behind those massive gates. I noticed that, for the average French citizen, even the sight of this national institution was awe-inspiring. I simply became very curious and wanted to know what was behind that imposing facade. As I wandered farther and higher up in the building, I ended up in the huge attic...the clock was under the cupola. Its glass face with Roman numerals gave me this fantastic view onto the Pont des Arts with the Louvre behind it.--Andr KertszLooking at this photograph simulates a feeling of standing beside the photographer, looking out on a wintry Parisian cityscape. Through Andr Kertsz's careful juxtaposition, the clock's silhouetted Roman numerals and hands appear to align with various elements of the scene below. The V points to the statue's shadow, the IIII traps two pedestrians, the III rests atop magazine stands flanking the Seine, and the star shape on the clock's hand blocks the far end of a bridge crossing the river. Darker than anything else, the clock's numerals and hand appear to be cut out and collaged onto the print's surface, rather than a natural part of the scene.This photograph demonstrates Kertsz's strategic use of flat, foreground elements against a deep background to suggest a sense of space. But he became most well known for his bird's-eye perspective, which reflects his desire to photograph behind the scenes from unconventional viewpoints.","H:  25 1 2 x W:  21 5 8 x D:  11 5 8 in.","Chromogenic print","German","Mahnomen County Fairgrounds, Mahnomen, Minnesota","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13414901.jpg","Constantijn Huygens the Younger","82.PB.70"

The other third of the composition belongs to the sky, in which a lone puff of white cloud hangs isolated like a cotton ball, holding sway against the force of the skyscraper. The brilliant white form is  lost  in this scene that is otherwise devoid of natural, spirited shapes. The cloud possesses an innate impermanence; it will be gone with the next gust of wind, blown along on its path to some other expanse of sky. Andre Kertsz's juxtaposition of the whimsical cloud and unforgiving architecture seems to emphasize his own sense of isolation; the photograph was made soon after he had emigrated from Europe.","6 ft. 3 5 8 in. x 3 ft. 4 9 16 in. x 1 ft. 4 1 8 in.","Oil on panel","French","Vase of Flowers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00081701.jpg","Jan van Huysum","78.PA.66"

The five ventilator petals dominate the frame like a strange metal flower, in contrast with the wavy grain of the surrounding unfinished wood.

Moths, beetles, wasps, flies, a ladybird, and a caterpillar are set in rows. Jan van Kessel I was one of the first artists to create horizontally arranged drawings of fruits and flowers, giving structure to essentially scientific analyses of insects. Instead of a specific setting, he preferred to use a blank ground, which allowed him to arrange the insects and fruits according to shifting yet interconnected vantage points.Van Kessel probably made this tight drawing in the studio, based on close sketches from nature. He used bodycolor to show volume, as in the luminous, patterned wings of the moths. Transparent washes represent the light effects, cast from a light source that creates dark shadows along the right sides of wings and underneath the insect's bodies, lifting them from the ground. Van Kessel assembled these insects to emphasize each specimen's crisp shapes and markings.","2 ft. 4 in. x 1 ft. 11 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","Greek","Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05064001.jpg","Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres","82.GD.106"

With this small gesture, Khnopff captured the child's vulnerability and uncertainty in facing the outside world. To further evoke a child's perception of a world scaled for grown-ups, he framed Jeanne Kfer's tiny body against the adult-sized door and tilted the floor ever so slightly.Jeanne is further isolated by the free, abstract brushwork in the reflective door window behind her. Typical for Khnopff, Jeanne is not warm and inviting but cut off in the shallow background, a fixed haunting gaze on her face.Khnopff became a popular society portrait painter in the 1880s, using elements that served him well as an avant-garde Symbolist painter: visual realism and a mood of silence, isolation, and reverie. He frequently posed his models leaning against a closed door, flattening the space and resulting in a meditative, hermetically sealed image.","13 13 16 x 10 3 16 in.","Pen and brown ink, and brownwash, heightened with white, with graphite, black and red chalk","French","The Duke of Alba Receiving the Pope's Blessing in the Cathedral of St.-Gudule, Brussels","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00045801.jpg","Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres","89.GD.50"

The back depicted the event for which the vase was a prize.On this example, Athena is shown in the usual fashion, wearing a helmet and her snaky-edged aegis and carrying a spear and shield. Leading vase-painters decorated these prize amphorae, which were commissioned in large quantities by the state, and their work can often be differentiated by themotifthey used to decorate the shield of Athena. For example, the Kleophrades Painter always used the winged horsePegasos, as seen here.

Early in his career, the Kleophrades Painter decorated the angular form of hydria, but he later switched to the kalpis. Other features, such as the depiction of a scene from everyday life and the type of ornament framing the panel, also suggest that this vase comes from the later phase of the Kleophrades Painter's career.","16 7 8 x 11 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","La frontera, Tijuana, Mxico (The Border, Tijuana, Mexico)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 28509301.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.5.10"

Both the painting and this drawing mark a major turning point in the evolution of Klimt's style. In their soft-focus handling, dreamlike atmosphere and pervasive eroticism, they reveal the influence of Symbolism, a key element in the art of the Vienna Secession, the avant-garde movement in which Klimt played a central role.The drawing is housed in a contemporary frame designed by the Wiener Werksttte, a collective of artists and designers with close links to the Secession.

"1881 - 1896","Gustav Klimt's favored working practice was somewhat unorthodox: he employed a number of nude models who lounged around his studio striking spontaneous poses, which he captured with a few exquisitely economical strokes of chalk or pencil. Many such life studies remained independent works of art, but others inspired paintings.These sketches of a kneeling woman, her generous buttocks thrust toward the viewer and her luxuriant hair cascading around her head as if caught by a current of air or water, ultimately served as preparatory drawings for the foreground figure in Klimt's paintingGoldfish(now in the Kunstmuseum Solothurn, Switzerland). In the finished painting, the nude retains this pose but turns her head to gaze impudently over her shoulder; Klimt initially titled it  To my critics  in reference to the controversy over three highly erotic murals he painted for the University of Vienna which had been attacked by the conservative press. The fluid, stylized treatment of the model's body and hair, which verges on abstraction, suggests his enduring identification of women with water--unbounded, immaterial and elusive--a common motif in his work.Although this drawing served as a study for another work, Klimt seems to have considered it a work of art in its own right. Not only did he sign it, he also published a reproduction of the right-hand figure in the Vienna Secession periodicalVer Sacrumin 1902; faint red pencil marks--cropping indications for the photographer--frame the figure.The drawing is housed in a facsimile of a frame designed by Klimt himself, exemplifying his commitment to the idea of theGesamtkunstwerk(total work of art).","6 7 8 x 5 3 16 in.","Albumen print","American","Cameron's Cone from  Tunnel 4 ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05670301.jpg","William Henry Jackson","84.XM.494.9"

Kniep enhanced the waterfall's visual impact by framing it with a shaded arch of massive boulders; his paper's immense size also emphasizes the cascade's force.Kniep spent most of his life in Italy, where he was influenced by the sun-drenched, idealized classical landscapes of his French predecessor Claude Lorrain. Yet Kniep overlaid Claude's legacy with the late 1700s concept of the Sublime, whose purpose was to inspire a noble and lofty awe by depicting powerful natural phenomena.Despite the drawing's large scale, Kniep rendered each element with a precision achieved, no doubt, by the  sharpening and resharpening of the best English pencils  that Johann Wolfgang von Goethe had noted during their trip to Italy together in 1787 and 1788. Many of the detailed sketches Kniep made during the trip were the basis for his later, more finished, imaginary landscapes such as this one. Kniep's intense fascination with the vegetation is indicative of German Neoclassicists' burgeoning scientific interests.","2 5 8 x 2 1 8 in.","Photochrom print","American","Marshall Pass, Colorado","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04703001.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.5.28"

The darkened foreground figures lead the eye upward to the platform where the dramatic forms of Christ and his tormentors stand silhouetted against the sky. The brilliant illumination of Christ's face and torso points to his focal role. While suggesting the teeming mob of onlookers with some sketchily drawn faces at the right, Knpfer mainly concentrated on a few foreground figures. Other characters, such as the carefree boy on the left playing with his top and the weeping woman outside the prison gates, add interest to the scene.","8 1 4 x 5 9 16 in.","Albumen print","American","Marshall Pass, Westside","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04702101.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.5.29"
"1883","The sageSolonstands to the right against an unadorned section of the room. His humble dress, long beard, and admonishing gesture contrasts with the extravagantly dressed figure of the king who points dramatically at the riches before him. In this moralizing scene from Greek legend, the wealthy KingCroesuscalls an audience with Solon, an Athenian lawmaker and philosopher. After proudly displaying his immense wealth, the king asks Solon to name the happiest man he has ever met. Solon does not name Croesus, instead responding that he could call no man happy until his life was so judged at its end and that humble people were often more content than the wealthiest kings. This moralistic tale, extremely popular in 1600s Holland, reflected the culture's ambivalent attitudes toward wealth and consumption.Nikolaus Knpfer used light to draw attention to the confrontation between the two figures. King Croesus and his queen are bathed in a bright light that illuminates their exquisite finery, the white satin and gold tablecloth, and the succulent delicacies and gold wares on the table. Light also falls upon the solitary figure of Solon, accentuating his isolated position below in the stage-like setting. This composition's carefully planned design and lighting reveal Knpfer's interest in contemporary Dutch theater.","20 x 48 in.","Albumen print","American","The Royal Gorge, Grand Canyon of the Arkansas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05669501.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.11.34"
"1885","Under a brilliant, clear blue sky, a sense of stillness and abandonment prevails in this scene, reinforced by creeping vegetation, grazing goats, and lizards scurrying across a dirt path. Behind the ancient city of Pompeii, Vesuvius silently looms, its presence serving as a terrifying reminder of the havoc it wrought in A.D. 79, when the city and its residents were buried beneath its molten lava. Christen Schjellerup Kbke drew the architectural remains of the forum with sharp precision, giving the painting a sense of order and clarity. He added a sense of drama by intensifying the contrast between light and dark, painting the foreground fragments almost completely in shadow.Excavations of the buried city began in 1748 and continue to this day. Scholars and curiosity seekers came in droves to see the ancient ruins. Kbke was one of many artists to visit the site, where he made detailed studies. After returning to his native Copenhagen, he set to work on this painting.","20 x 48 in.","Albumen print","French","Embudo, New Mexico","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05669601.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.5.34"

Sweeping clouds dominate the dramatic sky, emphasizing the low flat expanse of the land below. Patches of sunlight illuminate the water, trees, and buildings of a broad plain traversed by a winding river.Philips Koninck specialized in painting panoramic views of his native countryside. Although the view seems convincing, he composed this imaginary landscape from various raw elements of nature, playing with expressive lighting andperspectiveupon a natural stage. The view assumes a point of view high above the earth, which did not exist in the flat land of Holland.","121 1 2 x 28 1 2 x 39 1 2 in., 527 lb.","Albumen print","French","Grand Canyon of the Colorado River","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05678301.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.5.35"

He began with the wedge of land in theforeground: rivers, road, and fields converge on both sides, then gradually lead the viewer into the distance. Koninck also created depth through aerialperspective: color and tone fade as space recedes. In contrast to many Dutch artists of the 1600s who exploited watercolor's brilliant, jewel-like hues, Koninck chose a softpaletteof buffs and browns, deep green, gray, and light blue. He also made extensive use of bodycolor, applying this opaque mixture thickly and loosely, particularly in the foreground. His gentlebackgroundblue and smokychiaroscuroeffects evoke the atmosphere of a bright but hazy day.In this extremely rare colored landscape drawing, Koninck achieved the expansive space and rich atmosphere of his panoramic landscape paintings. The flatness of the Netherlands inspired this landscape drawing, but the view is imaginary rather than topographic.","37 13 16 x 29 1 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Dale Creek Bridge","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05670101.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.5.25"
"1886","Vase-painters working in the Greek colonies in South Italy frequently showed scenes of theatrical performances. Phlyax plays, popular in the 300s and 200s B.C., were farces parodying the heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life. The term phlyax, which is used for both the play and the costumed actors, probably derives from the Greek verb  to swell  and finds its meaning in the actors' costumes. They wore a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus; any other garments necessary for the role were worn over this.This Gnathian waresituladepicts a phlyax moving to the right along a dotted ground line while looking back over his shoulder. The economical scene makes it impossible to know what play is shown, but the figure is meant to be an African.As well as decorating vases in thered-figure technique,Apulianvase-painters created a type of pottery that scholars call Gnathian ware. In this technique, artisans glazed the entire surface of the vase black, then painted on the figures in added colors. This type of pottery began around 360 B.C. and was very popular in the period from about 350 to 325 B.C.","9 1 8 x 7 3 8 in.","Albumen print","American"," The Loop  near Georgetown, Colorado","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05670201.jpg","William Henry Jackson","85.XM.397.1"

Richly dressed, this muse wears a mantle decorated with groups of three white dots over her dress, and her cloth headband is equally lavish. She also wears several pieces of jewelry: adiadem, earrings, a necklace, and bracelet. The care the artist took with the rich details of this scene was typical of vases created in the 300s in the Greek colonies in South Italy.The fragment comes from a large calyx-krater decorated in a technique that scholars call Gnathian. The painter covered the entire surface of the vase with a black glaze and then added his decoration over the glaze. The bright, wide-ranging colorpaletteseen on this fragment is typical of Gnathian pottery.

The Roman's bravery so impressed Porsenna, however, that he set Scaevola free.The design is crammed with fanciful details, all intended as a model for a stained-glass window, one of a series on Roman heroes and heroines. The background shows the towers of Rome, which resembles a walled Renaissance town more than an ancient, classical city, surrounded by medieval siege engines. A heavily ornamented arch supported by a pair of robust columns frames the scene. Profiles of a king and an emperor decorate the coffered arch, while other vaguely classical motifs fill the arch, the sides of the columns, and the frieze along the base. The shield at the bottom remains empty except for the Roman numeralxxiii,perhaps signifying the twenty-third window in the series.

In an effort to avoid breakage, the legs of the figure are only partially separated; the feet of this figure have broken off. Anatomical features such as arms are modeled three-dimensionally, whereas in later types, sculptors rendered this feature with incised lines.

"1775 - 1777","An executioner holds his sword aloft, ready to slice the baby, while one woman frantically grabs his arm, begging him to stop. Hans von Kulmbach showed the dramatic climax of the story in which the wise KingSolomonwas asked to judge between the claims of two women who had each given birth to a child at the same time. When one of the babies died, both women demanded the remaining infant. To determine the truth, Solomon ordered his guards to cut the living child in half and give a portion to each. The real mother then rushed forward to prevent the act, so that her child might be spared. Onlookers with beards and exotic headgear, looking much likeRenaissanceEuropean Jews, observe the scene, while the other mother points to her dead child lying at the foot of the stairs.In this design for a stained-glass window, Kulmbach sketched the scene with a brush and wash before reinforcing it with ink lines. After the artist had produced such a design, known as acartoon, a glass specialist then cut and painted colored glass in shapes and colors according to the design or painted the scene on colorless glass panels.","9 1 4 x 7 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","Flemish","Hands of an Engineer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06269401.jpg","Gobelins Tapestry Manufactory","71.DD.469"

Clad only in crumpled white and red drapery gathered around her waist, Scylla leans forward, gesturing with her hand. Behind her, Cupid looks ready to let loose another arrow.

Thus his works were in demand, and he himself was held in high esteem.

From a large tome held on his lap, he lifts a sheet of paper. Intending to declare the sitter's erudition, wealth, and status, Maurice-Quentin de La Tour placed de Rieux in his study, surrounded by fashionable and expensive objects. Behind him is a richly ornamental screen; on a table covered with blue velvet cloth are books, papers, and an inkstand with a quill pen. A globe stands next to the table and a Turkish carpet covers the floor. These objects identify the sitter as a connoisseur of fine and precious thing--like his father, whose considerable fortune de Rieux inherited the year this portrait was painted.This large, full-length portrait, still in its original, massive gilt frame, was assembled from separate sheets of paper laid on canvas and drawn entirely in pastel. The most sought-after portraitist of his day, La Tour worked exclusively in pastel, producing likenesses of the nobility and the wealthy middle class that were applauded for both their technical mastery and their astonishing verisimilitude.  In fact, one contemporary critic marveled that such a work as this portrait could be created using crayons.","8 7 8 x 7 5 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchmentbound between pasteboard covered with saffron-colored doeskin","Flemish","The Discovery and Translation of the Body of Saint Anthony","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00165001.jpg","Dreux Jean","89.XM.75.1"

The scarf tied around his head suggests he is working in his studio. La Tour candidly recorded his 73-year-old subject's blood vessels, wrinkles, and moles, giving De Silvestre realistic human qualities that formal portraiture of the period did not often capture. He and La Tour were friends, which also contributes to the intimacy of the portrait. Made seven years before de Silvestre's death, this drawing strikingly conveys the physical effects of age.","8 7 8 x 7 7 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, gold paint, and ink on parchment","Flemish","A Young Knight in Armor Kneeling in Prayer before Saint Anthony","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00441501.jpg","Reverend Calvert Richard Jones","78.PA.69"

"1713","Using a delicate pattern of red chalk lines to illustrate the play of light on the folds of the two men's clothing, Nicolas Lancret portrayed an elegant courtier on the left and a flutist on the right. Black chalk strokes define the elements of emphasis: the rippling folds on their breeches and cloak and each man's little nose and mouth. White lines add touches of silvery highlights to the costumes. Like his idol and rival Jean-Antoine Watteau, Lancret particularly favored the effects of combining three colors of chalk in the technique known astrois crayons. Among the many artists who imitated the brilliant flickering style of Watteau's chalk work, Lancret mastered it best and developed it into a personal idiom, evolving strokes that were looser and more ethereal than those of Watteau.Lancret probably sketched the figures as a life study, not in preparation for a particular painting. Later, when he required a particular gesture or movement for one of his paintings, he would have referred back to his drawings.","17 7 8 in.","Pen and brown ink and brownwashover black chalk","Dutch","Christ Carrying the Cross","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00047801.jpg","Francesco Natale Juvara","88.GA.1"

"1917","In Giovanni Lanfranco's highly original design, a few large figures stand on a bit of ground in a wide open, receding space. Using a low viewpoint and dramatic foreshortening, Lanfranco depicted the figures as if seen from below, imbuing them with monumentality. The powerful composition communicated both to spectators standing far away and to viewers standing far beneath the painting.In the Old Testament story (Numbers 13:1-27), Moses sent spies into Canaan to determine whether the land bore fruit. Lanfranco depicted these spies as they returned, laden with grapes, pomegranates, and figs as signs of the plenty of the Promised Land. Laying the ample harvest at Moses' feet, they reported,  surely it floweth with milk and honey.

Dorothea Lange made this photograph of a labor strike while working with the economist Paul Taylor, who would become her second husband. Taylor was covering the General Strike of 1934 for the social welfare journalSurvey Graphic. At the time, most political discussions centered on labor issues, and artists like Lange felt compelled to get involved. Lange's interest in the plight of laborers began as she assessed the evidence of the Great Depression from her studio window. Late in life, Lange recalled that she could see the unemployed drifting about and pause as they wondered where to go next. She began making photographs outside her studio-of breadlines, labor demonstrations, and strikes like the one seen here. Though Lange said she initially  did not have the slightest idea  what she would do with images like this, she continued making them as a direct response to what she saw, eventually focusing entirely on what would become known as documentary photography.Gift of David and Marcia Raymond in honor of their father Paul Raymond","43 7 8 x 34 7 16 in.","Marble","Roman","Storage Jar with a Pedestal Foot","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01511401.jpg","Meissen Porcelain Manufactory","83.DE.271"

Lange made six exposures of this striking woman, who lived in a makeshift shelter with her husband and seven children in a Nipomo, California, pea-picker's camp. Within twenty-four hours of making the photographs, Lange presented them to an editor at theSan Francisco News, who alerted the federal government to the migrants' plight. The newspaper then printed two of Lange's images with a report that the government was rushing in 20,000 pounds of food, to rescue the workers.Lange made this photograph while working for the Resettlement Administration, a government agency dedicated to documenting the devastating effects of the Depression during the 1930s. Her image depicts the hardship endured by migratory farm workers and provides evidence of the compelling power of photographs to move people to action.","10 11 16 x 6 7 8 in.","Hard-paste porcelain, polychrome enamel decoration;giltbronze mounts","American","Group of Japanese Figures","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00665601.jpg","Gertrude Stanton Ksebier","87.XM.59.28"

Despite the weight of their baskets, these seasonal workers were paid miserable wages. Dorothea Lange made this photograph in 1938 near Tracy, California, a stopping place for migrant laborers looking for work. At the time, hundreds of migrants were arriving in California every day. Many of the new arrivals had been working as tenant farmers in the Midwest until they were replaced by machinery. Others were victims of the Dust Bowl-a period of severe drought that struck the Great Plains of the United States in the early 1930s. Donning a cowboy hat and a large bonnet to keep the sun out of their eyes, Lange's anonymous subjects are shown making their way to the scale in identical strides.

Dorothea Lange made this photograph at the Raphael Weill School in San Francisco's Japantown. A few weeks after Lange captured this image, the U.S. government relocated this innocent girl, and thousands of other Japanese Americans, to desolate areas east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.The attack on Pearl Harbor, which marked the beginning of direct American involvement in World War II, triggered the rise of assaults on the Japanese in America. Lange's photograph speaks to a shameful part of America's history, when all persons of Japanese descent were forced into internment camps because of their supposed risk to national security.

Over 100,000 Japanese Americans were uprooted and moved to desolate areas east of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.Lange probably made this picture at the Tanforan Assembly Center in San Mateo, California. At the  assembly center --a  racetrack where horse stalls had been converted into barracks--families spent weeks waiting to be sent further east.

She documented factory workers in Richmond, California, a booming harbor town near her home, where ships were being built twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.These two factory workers appear to be taking a break between shifts. The scarcity of their personal time is suggested by a parking meter, which reads  violation  and dominates the picture'sforeground. Although Lange captured a private moment between the lovers, her view of them is not sentimental. The image's relatively darktonalrange underscores an ominous quality--in part suggested by the man's tight grip around the woman's neck--and the stark backdrop of factory buildings in the distance. Lange's low camera angle also isolates her subjects from their surroundings.","27 3 8 x 19 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","The Dancing Faun (Eugenio Kertsz)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06235501.jpg","Andr Kertsz","84.XM.193.29"

Philip was a highly successful political leader of his day as well as an important and influential patron of manuscript illumination. The witty scene illustrates a noblewoman's endeavor to deal with her husband's Christian mistress. In the chapel at right, the wife of the adulterous knight prays for the Virgin Mary to avenge her by punishing the mistress. However, Mary refuses the request on account of the adulteress's deep devotion to her. Subsequently when wife and mistress encounter one another in the street the mistress is so embarrassed--she falls to her knees--she promises to give up the husband. Meanwhile the wayward husband cowers behind the chapel. Given the duke's own serial philandering--he fathered several dozen children outside his marriage and relatively few within it--one cannot help but wonder how he responded to this moralizing tale.The miniature is painted entirely in grey tones, a technique called grisaille, popular in the later Middle Ages.

The boat not only refers to his imminent journey but also presages one further in his future. After preaching in Spain, James is said to have returned to Judea, where he was decapitated; his head, set adrift in a boat, miraculously washed ashore in northwestern Spain, where it was then buried and forgotten. Its later rediscovery heightened interest in the saint, and hisrelicsattracted many Christian pilgrims.

In the middle distance stands a draped cross surmounted by the lamb of God. In the semicircle at the top of the miniature, God the Father, crowned, enthroned, flanked by angels, and surrounded by saints, holds Jesus' dead body upon his lap.In traditional representations of All Saints, the figures stand virtually undifferentiated in a row. The illuminator Lieven van Lathem broke with this tradition by dividing them into groups and setting them within a landscape. His creation of this deep panoramic landscape in an area of only three-by-two inches testifies to his exceptional skill.

Joseph is modeled with subtle twists in his body, amplified by his buoyant and billowing tunic and cloak. Even his curly hair flutters with a life of its own. Fashioned from white-bodied earthenware, known as creamware, the figures are painted with lustrous jewel-like colors. Their theatricality is characteristic of Baroque sculpture.Athough most depictions present Saint Joseph as elderly, he is portrayed here as a youthful and handsome father. Inspired by the new focus on Jesus' human and family life and encouraged by the philosophies of the Counter-Reformation, the cult of Saint Joseph became more popular in the second half of the 1700s, when this sculpture was made.The subject and composition of this work are identical to those of a life-size marble of 1790 to 1791 by the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino in the Taranto Cathedral. Sanmartino produced a number of terracotta sketches for his large-scale sculpture; this small-scale ceramic group by Gennaro Laudato probably copied one of these and was intended as a collector's object or devotional piece.","2 15 16 to 3 1 8 x 9 7 8 x 7 5 8 in.","Black chalk and red pencil","Dutch","Two Studies of a Seated Nude with Long Hair","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31887301.jpg","Christoph Henrich Kniep","92.GA.73"

The half-length figure rises from an ovalplinthand grasps a palm and a laurel branch in one hand. Conventional signs of martyrdom and victory over death, the branches help identify the figure as the infant Saint Cyricus. In 304 this Roman toddler was martyred at the age of two and a half years, along with his mother Saint Julitta, a Christian who refused to pray to  false idols.  According to legend, Saint Cyricus endured brutal tortures: sawing in half, flaying, and boiling in a cauldron. These episodes may have inspired both the unusual half-length form of this representation and the oval plinth, which recalls the shape of a cauldron. Francesco Laurana combined traditional symbols of sainthood such as the palm and laurel branches, specific references to the saint's life story, and a remarkablenaturalism, making the work all the more moving by suggesting the horror of tortures perpetrated upon a helpless infant.","15 3 4 x 7 7 8 x 1 16 in.","Pencil, pen and black ink, and brownwash","South Italian","A Shepherd and Muses by a Waterfall","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00050901.jpg","Nikolaus Knpfer","84.PB.640"

A powerful figure in the 1600s and 1700s, the keeper of seals acted as minister of justice and was second in command to the chancellor of France.

The image's only direct light seems to seek out this human intrusion, somehow vindicating the notion that the experience of nature requires instructions.

His clothing is wrinkled, and patterned fabric untidily extrudes between his vest and trousers. The hand tucked dramatically into his vest hides the lens of his monocle, with the cord barely visible underneath.

The  moonlight  effect...was due to the necessary exposure.So wrote a reviewer after the photograph was first exhibited in 1856. Though no seam can be found between sea and sky, viewers speculated that this image, like other seascapes by Le Gray, was acombination print. In the 1850s, it was virtually impossible to render both sea and sky in the same negative. If the photographer exposed the film so that the sea or land was fully rendered, the sky would be overexposed and appear white; if exposed for the sky, the sea or land would appear dark as a silhouette. As it happened, the luminosity of the cloud-laden sky was equal to that of the water, making it possible for Le Gray to render each area exquisitely in a single negative. Here the sun breaks through the clouds at the upper right and reflects on the sea's shimmering surface directly below. The brig appears to sail just into or out of the watery clearing.","11 1 8 x 9 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Glaucus and Scylla","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00084701.jpg","Laurent de La Hyre","92.GB.27"

"1739 - 1741","Active scenes in nature, such as a moving boat and waves breaking on the rocks, had never been photographed before, but Gustave Le Gray was an indomitable innovator whose technical improvements to the medium shortened his exposure times. What he could not improve upon, however, was the simultaneous exposure of sea and sky. Given photography's chemical limitations at that time, if he exposed the negative so that the sea was rendered clearly, the sky would be so overexposed as to appear empty. If he exposed for the sky, the sea and shore would appear only as silhouettes. In this composition, he opted to let the sea and land dominate. In reality, the blowing sails and choppy waters indicate a more tumultuous sky than the one seen here.Around 1855 Le Gray began to make a series of seascapes and maritime studies. This view was made at Ste, a Mediterranean port in southern France; it was taken from roughly the same position on the bank asLe Grande Vague, Ste(The Great Wave, Ste). This print's vertical format, the only one among Le Gray's many seascapes, emphasizes the boats' blowing sails.","9 1 8 x 6 3 4 in.","Black chalk and brown wash","French","The Liberation of Saint Peter","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00032301.jpg","Georges de La Tour","94.PC.39"

The photographs commemorating the Guard's six-week presence at the camp were subsequently assembled into presentation albums given by the Emperor to each general.Napoleon and the Empress Eugnie stayed in a tent of plain blue and white striped ticking,  recalling nothing of the luxury that always accompanies a sovereign.  They clearly did not eschew all luxury; here Le Gray records the preparations for a banquet outside of the Imperial tent. Though the seating consists of camp stools, two soldiers have draped the tables with heavy white damask cloths and set them with crystal.","9 3 8 x 7 in.","Black and white chalk, blue and rose pastel on faded blue paper","French","Portrait of Louis de Silvestre","www.getty.edu art collections images l 18219301.jpg","Adlade Labille-Guiard","97.PA.65"
"1860s - 1870s","Around 1855 Gustave Le Gray began a series of seascapes and maritime studies that were unprecedented for their dynamic compositions. This is one of the first photographs giving the appearance of stopping motion. The view was made at Ste, a Mediterranean port in southern France, and was taken from roughly the same position on the bank asThe Broken Wave, Ste (La Vague Brise, Ste).Given the limitations of photographic chemistry at that time, if Le Gray made his exposure so that the sea would be clearly rendered, the sky would be so overexposed as to appear empty, but if he exposed for the sky, the sea and shore would appear as silhouettes. His solution was to make acombination print: the stormy clouds are one negative, while the sea with its crashing waves and the blackened jetty moored on the horizon are another. The seamless result is a coherent evocation of nature's dramatic activity.","4 5 8 x 3 9 16 in.","Pastel on paper","French","Head of a Young Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11104201.jpg","Louis Jean Franois Lagrene","99.GF.54"

Seated on one-legged stools, the outer circle of men listen with their hands on their knees while the points of their swords rest on the parched earth. Known as Zouaves, these soldiers were famous for their bravery and for their spirited theatrical antics. Gustave Le Gray photographed this group as part of a commission to document a military training camp outside Paris. Aware that the Zouaves were highly entertaining to their fellow soldiers, as well as to the Emperor, Le Gray photographed this regiment more often than any other.","4 3 4 x 3 3 4 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Mars & Venus, Allegory of Peace","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11370001.jpg","Maxime Lalanne","90.GG.136"
"1730","Alternately titledLe Vapeur(The Steamship), this photograph of a tugboat leaving a black cloud of steam in its wake is a study in atmospheric textures. Presumably pulling the sailing ship back to port, the tugboat, which is dwarfed by the luxury boat, exerts itself fully, judging from the vaporous emission that it spouts in the effort. The activity stands in dramatic relief to the serenity of the sea that it crosses; a few other boats are barely visible dots on the horizon. Gustave Le Gray favored such fleeting moments, scenes that existed only long enough to be photographed. He positioned his camera to eliminate all reference to the shoreline, which gives the illusion that the photographer was on the water with the vessels.","8 9 16 x 6 3 4 in.","Charcoal","German","Castle Overlooking a River","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13632701.jpg","Georges Lallemant","78.DG.180"

Standing within the elevated boundary of the Emperor's quarters, Le Gray rotated his camera on an axis to capture Napolon's striped tent on the left, the vast plain with hundreds of tiny white tents in the distance, and, on the far right, an elevated altar for mass. The concentration on the middle ground emphasizes the expanse of space, and the scale of the military enterprise. Though the character of the light changes from one part of the landscape to another, Le Gray achieved a seamless continuity between the segmented images.","8 13 16 x 6 7 8 in.","Black ink, graywash, white heightening, on yellow paper","Italian","Reclining Old Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00039901.jpg","Paul de Lamerie","2000.49"

For the fortunate few who could afford it, such luxurious custom cars were available, though their passengers were still subject to violent jolts when the train started. But for the majority of passenger, railroad travel was incredibly uncomfortable in the 1800s. Most passenger cars had little more to offer than wooden seats or benches and a pot-bellied stove.Gustave Le Gray's interest in railroads appears to have been minimal; few prints of the subject by him exist. In 1859, the first year photographs were included at theSalon, Le Gray exhibited this image in a gallery adjoining that for the official Salon painting.","7 x 5 in.","Watercolor over traces of black chalk, with touches of whitegouache","Italian","A Couple Embracing in an Artist's Studio","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13878501.jpg","Nicolas Lancret","9 5 8 x 12 9 16 in."

Paving stones lead the viewer's eye directly to the corner of the pavilion, where the sunlit facade is further highlighted beside an area blanketed in shadow.Though the extensive art collections of the Louvre had first been opened to the public in 1793, after the French Revolution, it was not until 1848 that the museum became the property of the state.

He believed in racial equality and the abolition of capital punishment, and led numerous revolutionary campaigns against the repressive French monarchy in the kingdom that included Naples and Sicily.

By the middle of the 1700s, these drinks had become part of the daily life of the aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie, requiring new serving vessels from which to pour them. Chocolate was considered a breakfast drink, tea was drunk in the afternoon, and coffee was taken after dinner.Porcelain was the favorite material for tea, coffee, and chocolate services, as it did not crack with heat and remained fairly cool to the touch, unlike silver vessels. This tea service, consisting of two cups and saucers, a covered sugar bowl, teapot, and tray, displaysRococoshapes and Neoclassical-style painted decoration. The pierced and lobed tray, with ribbons entwined around the handles and latticework panels, is typically Rococo; in contrast, the use of neat, symmetrical arrangements of floral garlands and arabesques is aNeoclassicaltrait.","8 5 8 x 6 7 16 in.","Oil on canvas","American","Elijah Receiving Bread from the Widow of Zarephath","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00072701.jpg","Giovanni Lanfranco","89.GG.18"

Its heavily decorated surface combined various complicated techniques: jeweling, painted cameos, and painted scenes. The expensive technique known asjeweling,using stamped gold foils set with colored enamels to imitate pearls and precious jewels in red, yellow, orange, and green, was used at the Svres Porcelain Manufactory for only five years, between 1780 and 1785.On the sides of the cup and saucer, slightly domed oval plaques of porcelain have been attached, imitating stone cameos with profiles of classical busts.

"1934","Leaning back, Venus, goddess of love and beauty, gently twists her head to look at the small wreath she holds aloft in her left hand. Nude, her drapery falling down upon her legs, she rests on a rock amidst seashells. According to myth, Venus was born from the foam of the sea, an aspect of her legend suggested by the sculpture's title, Venus Marina. Although cupid or a dolphin usually accompanies Venus Marina, neither are present here.This tabletop bronze was made after a model attributed to the French sculptor Robert Le Lorrain. As was characteristic of the Rococo period, the sculpture is a subtle work with no large movements or heroic story. A restrained sensuality of delicate curves and flowing drapery dominates as the sculptor focused on small variations of texture and line. He contrasted, for example, the complex shape and rough texture of the striated rock with Venus's smooth skin and simple open forms. Other similar Venus figures attest to the popularity of this genre of sculpture in France in the early 1700s.","4 3 8 x 3 1 16 in.","Pand and black ink with gray, ocher, brown, and orange washes","American","Stained-Glass Design for a Married Couple","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00027901.jpg","Dorothea Lange","2001.86"

This scene of Ajax and Achilles gaming was very popular in Athenian vase-painting of the late 500s B.C. and was a favorite of the painters in the Leagros Group. Many scholars believe that this mythological scene also served as a contemporary political parable on the value of staying alert, since the tyrant Peisistratos had been able to take control of the city of Athens while the army was distracted. The back of the vase depicts three hoplites, or warriors, in a line. Such files of hoplites are rather unusual in vase-painting, and this depiction may have been meant to relate to the scene on the front of the vase.

Leonardo depicted the man's hair with his characteristicsfumato. The hatching lines slant downward from left to right, running in the natural direction for the left-handed artist. He made this caricature as one of a large series of head studies created in pairs. Years after the artist's death, collectors cut the pairs into individual drawings. Many later artists admired and copied Leonardo's caricatures, both in drawings and prints.","11 1 2 x 9 in.","Oakveneeredwith red-, green-, and cream-painted horn and brass; enameled metal;giltbronze","Dutch","Wall Clock on Bracket","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00629801.jpg","Nicolas de Largillire","83.DE.341"

Lastly, he drew the more elaborate study at the bottom left, in which the legs are posed with greater complexity and the child leans back on the lamb.Leonardo probably made the drawing in preparation for a painting of the Virgin and Child with Saint John, now lost but known through copies.

Made from aluminum, three vertical  strokes  of pure color are frozen in space and rise to a height of more than ten feet. One edge of the yellow brushstroke cuts through the dominant stroke of black and blue; the yellow also curves into a diminutive stroke of red paint.Each brushstroke is a fully realized three-dimensional form that, somewhat implausibly, allows the viewer to experience a stroke of paint from different vantage points. The sculpture humorously reminds us that paint is literally three-dimensional.Roy Lichtenstein first explored brushstrokes as a subject in a series of paintings initiated in 1965. As with many of his works, he used a comic book source--a panel of an artist at work fromStrange Suspense Stories--as the basis for his brushstrokes. The subject became one of the artist's most recognizable images and he would return regularly to the brushstrokemotiffor more than thirty years. In the early 1980s, Lichtenstein began creating sculptural brushstrokes.","11 7 8 x 9 1 8 in.","Oil on panel","Flemish","The Resurrection","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00093301.jpg","Pieter Lastman","MS. 103"

He depicted the woman in bright light and wearing a richly colored skirt, thus omitting obvious signs of poverty and avoiding an unnecessary display of sentimentality.Influenced by the Dutch Masters of the 1600s, Liebermann became fascinated with themes that concerned contemplative states. He also absorbed the lessons of French painters; his richly worked execution of this painting reflects thepainterlystyle he learned in Paris in the 1870s.The Old Woman with Catwas painted in 1878 in Venice, where Liebermann went to recuperate after breaking his leg.

Lievens used a rare and costly sheet of Japanese paper for this drawing. The slightly iridescent surface of the paper gives the composition an added warmth and rich sheen.

This gesture communicated a particular message to medieval Catholics in Western Europe.

Images like this decorated altar frontals in Romanesque churches as a somber reminder of the coming Day of Judgment.In this gilded copper representation, Christ holds a jeweled Bible and his feet rest on an ornate enamel plaque. This Christ in Majesty served as the centerpiece of an ensemble of 52 saint and apostle figures. Together they were commissioned for the high altar of a cathedral in Orense, Spain, a stop along a famous pilgrimage route. Artisans in Limoges, France, a renowned center for the production of enamel, created this plaque and its ensemble. Most of the surviving figures lack inset pieces of glass that decorate Christ's tunic, but have similar, bead-like eyes. Visually they all relate to one another, with highly ornamental enameled backgrounds, similar to the plaque at Christ's feet. Their patterns are also dark and light blue, with white, gold, green, and red-brown accents.This figure was formed from a single sheet of copper hammered on the reverse side to  create the raised design in front. Features such as the beard, mustache, and folds of the tunic are etched into its surface. Large areas of gilding have worn away, primarily on the raised surfaces, suggesting that this object was touched over many centuries by the faithful who prayed before it.","6 1 2 x 4 5 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, silver paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00193101.jpg","Lieven van Lathem","MS. 37, FOL. 34V"

"1469","Changing attitudes towards children and the emergence of a large middle class in eighteenth-century Europe increased the demand for portraits of children such as this one. Maria Frederike, the seven-year-old daughter of an aristocratic Dutch family, looks off to the side in a three-quarter view. Lost in thought, she is composed yet somewhat shy in comparison to her dog, who stares out with unabashed curiosity. With startlingnaturalism, Jean-tienne Liotard captured her youth and beauty, setting off her eyebrows, lashes, and lustrous hair against her soft, fresh complexion.Liotard developed remarkable technical skills in the difficult medium of pastels. Brilliantly describing surfaces and defining volume through subtle gradations of color, he depicted forms, textures, and the play of light with great immediacy. He favored using pastels, especially for portraits of children, because they could be manipulated with greater speed and ease, had no odor, and allowed for frequent interruptions.","9 5 8 x 7 3 4 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, silver paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Saint Hubert","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00193601.jpg","Lieven van Lathem","MS. 37, FOL. 43"

I owe this accomplishment . . . to the fact that I always try to give a maximum of fullness and relief in my pictures.A master at capturing sitters in fleeting moments of informality, Jean-tienne Liotard depicted this unknown sitter possessed with a remarkable degree of warmth and depth. She leans back slightly and sits with her hands casually folded in her lap, gazing to the side. Liotard's delicate application of white chalk records the details of her flounced sleeves and ruffled collar, and beautifully highlights the subject's attractive features.Liotard likely made this drawing in preparation for a pastel; the broad application of chalk indicates that Liotard made it as a kind of rough draft. The drawing remained in the artist's studio and with his family until well into the 1900s. Most likely, Liotard kept it as a record after the finished pastel left his studio, though no other such work featuring this sitter is known.","2 9 16 x 4 3 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, silver paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Saint Eutrope Healing a Cripple","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00193701.jpg","Lieven van Lathem","MS. 37, FOL. 45"
"1469","For his portrait of Charles-Benjamin de Langes de Montmirail, the Baron de Lubires, Jean-tienne Liotard drew on both sides of a thin sheet of cream-colored paper. On the verso surface, the artist delicately applied red and black pastels to achieve richer and more subtle degrees of tone and relief on the finely detailed recto. This novel technique is found in several of Liotard's portraits of the period and derives from the tradition of toning miniatures on ivory on the verso.A wealthy and erudite amateur, the Baron de Lubires was part of the writer Voltaire's circle in Geneva and contributed several articles to Diderot'sEncyclopdie.Replete with fur muff, the fashionably attired sitter is clearly a gentleman of his time. Despite the attention to dress, Liotard depicted his sitter without adornment. The Baron de Lubires is in profile against a plain background with little depth. Nothing is allowed to overshadow the close likeness of the sitter achieved by Liotard. And it is this close likeness, above all else, that is intended to speak of the Baron de Lubires as a man of singular refinement and distinction.","7 5 8 x 9 5 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","Flemish","All Saints","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00193801.jpg","Lieven van Lathem","MS. 37, FOL. 46V"

"1469","Chineseporcelainand tea-drinking were the rage of fashionable Europe when Jean-tienne Liotard was born. He began painting tea and coffee sets in the last two decades of his life when age, changes in taste, and his political beliefs caused a decline in requests for thepastelportraits that were his specialty. He had, however, been including fruit and porcelain still lifes in some of his portraits since about 1740. Only five of his paintings of tea and coffee sets are known today.In this painting of tea-time disarray, a tray is set with six cups and saucers, a teapot, sugar bowl, milk jug, and a lidded vase perhaps containing an extra supply of tea leaves. A large bowl holding a teacup and saucer could also be used for dumping the slops of cold tea and used tea leaves. By the time Liotard painted this work in the late 1700s, tea-drinking had become fashionable among the middle as well as the upper classes. Liotard contrasted the luxurious materials of Chinese porcelain and silver with a cheaper tray of painted tin, known astle,that imitated Asianlacquer. Combining the transparent, reflective and brightly-patterned objects allowed the artist to portray strong visual contrasts.","13 1 2 x 10 1 2 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, silver paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Noli me tangere","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00194001.jpg","Lieven van Lathem","MS. 37, FOL. 49V"

"1471","Claude Lorrain bathed this view of Tivoli in shimmering, translucent washes whose tonal range represents a continuum of light and shadow that both defines and dematerializes form. Characteristically, he silhouetted forms against expanses of golden Italian light. The pen-and-ink study on the verso may have been made first as a compositional outline for the drawing on the recto.More than thirty views of Tivoli, one of Claude's favorite subjects, survive. As always, he focused on the landscape rather than village architecture. He drew this study from nature, rather than composing it in the studio, and he may have used it in preparing a painting.According to a German painter colleague, Joachim von Sandrart, Tivoli played a role in Claude's decision to painten plein air(outdoors) rather than only in the studio:  [I]n Tivoli, in the wild rocks at the famous cascade . . . he found me painting from life and saw that I painted many works from nature itself, making nothing from imagination; this pleased himself so much that he applied himself eagerly to adopting the same method.

"1471","The maiden Europa rests atop a white bull, unaware it is the god Jupiter in disguise. According to the tale in Ovid'sMetamorphoses, soon the animal will abduct her across the waves. Until then, she and her attendants festoon the seemingly innocent beast with flowers, while her blue drapery flutters in the breeze. In the upper right corner, a hazy poetic light illuminates her home city of Tyre, further evoking an idyllic antique world.Claude Lorrain is known for painting complicated images that achieve a tranquil balance. This scene appears bucolic, but his composition and details also hint of impending danger. Beyond the field of delicate flowers, for example, a craggy tower looms. The women fail to notice that the bull is poised in anticipation, already straightening one of his legs for flight. Whitecaps gather behind them on the darkening sea, the backdrop to Europa's fate.Even in his day, Claude was known for developing a style called the Ideal Landscape, in which nature on the canvas surpasses the real thing in its beauty, harmony, and refinement. Here he balances formal elements, like the upright trees, ship, and towers, against the open expanse of sea and sky. Offshore, he juxtaposes the huge galleon and all its impeccable detail in the rigging and carved decoration, with Europa still on land. The maritime theme also had a deeper resonance for Claude's contemporaries, as in art criticism, the abduction of Europa was compared to a ship leaving shore.French by birth, and working in Rome, Claude often went into the countryside to do studies of nature.  One of his hallmarks is the use of a unifying light, which gives this work a kind of gentle glow. The romance is punctuated by long shadows coming in from the left, distinctive of his favorite afternoon light, which help frame the drama at center stage.","14 x 10 11 16 in.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","French","Charles the Bold Presented by an Angel","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00194501.jpg","Lieven van Lathem","MS. 37, FOL. 82V"

The substantial forms of the Muses fill the scene, blocking much of the more delicate landscape that was Claude's most frequent subject.

He was a slow and painstaking draftsman; this drawing is one of his few important, completely finished works. He proceeded slowly, first drawing the entire scene in outline down to the smallest detail with a faint but hard pencil and then finishing and coloring the work on location, rather than in a studio. An English tourist wrote of Lusieri:  As an artist he was always slow in deliberation; but it was the tardiness of the most scrupulous accuracy; for he frequently laid on even his colours on the spot...

"1650 - 1660","The Minotaur, a monster with a bull's head and a human body, was the son of the Cretan queen and a bull for which she had developed an irresistible passion. The Minotaur lived in a labyrinth on Crete and devoured human sacrifices of youths and maidens sent as tribute from Athens. When the Greek heroTheseusfinally killed the monster, he freed Athens from this horrible burden. The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur was very popular on Athenian vases in the late 500s B.C., possibly due to the Athenian connection with the myth. In this rendition, Theseus plunges his sword through the monster's neck while the freed youths and maidens watch. The youths are shown nude, in poses similar to those found on contemporarykouroi. In his depiction of the encounter, the artist stressed the Minotaur's bestial nature. The Minotaur's weapon is a rock, seen clutched in his hoof-like hand, whereas civilized Theseus fights with a sword. The back of the vase shows two youths mounted on horses, greeted by family members as they return home. Such a scene of returning youths and warriors was a frequent one in Athenian vase-painting. The youths may be mythological figures such as the Dioskouroi, or they may simply be mortals.","21 5 16 x 8 9 16 in.","Silk and wool","French","Tapestry: Portire aux Armes de France","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00672901.jpg","Charles Le Brun","91.DH.18"

"1857","Asatyrholding a drinking cup decorates the interior of this Athenian red-figure cup.  Satyrs, part-human, part-animal companions ofDionysos, the god of wine, were a popular and fitting decoration for cups like this one intended for use at a symposion or drinking party. The decoration on this cup provides a good example of the reason that by the early 400s B.C. most Athenian vase-painters preferred to work in thered-figure technique. As this moving satyr shows, Greek artists of this period were extremely interested in accurately depicting the human body and its changes in musculature and posture. Theblack-figure technique, in which all internal markings were incised equally through the black silhouette of the figure, was inherently limited in its ability to do this. The red-figure technique with its painted internal detail was more suitable for the task.On this vase, Makron used heavy lines of black glaze, actually raised from the surface of the vase, for large contours of the body. He then applied lines of diluted glaze, which fired brown rather than black, for smaller musculature. This varied intensity of line enabled the artist to give a sense of mass and three-dimensionality to the satyr.","14 5 16 x 10 5 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Cavalry Maneuvers, Camp at Chlons","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06845101.jpg","Gustave Le Gray","84.XM.637.1"
"1857","A reveler dances away the night, holding onto his cup with one hand and his walking stick with the other. Many Greek vases, especially elaborate cups, were designed for use atsymposiaor drinking parties. Therefore, vase-painters frequently decorated these vessels with scenes of revelry and drinking. Consuming the wine in the cup revealed the joyous dancer at its bottom. The circular area or tondo on the interior of a cup presented a compositional problem for Greek vase-painters. It was difficult to place upright figures in this limited, curving space. Some artists placed decidedly linear figures in the circular space or drew a line across the circle in order to create an artificial ground-line for their figures. Others, like the artist Makron on this cup, clearly were trying to work out innovative compositions. By means of carefully positioned limbs, he managed to give the dancing reveler an almost circular outline, echoing its frame.","14 5 16 x 10 1 8 in.","Albumen print","French","Camp de Chlons: Setting the Emperor's Table","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06845201.jpg","Gustave Le Gray","84.XM.637.5"

He also added the titleLe Violon d'Ingres, a French idiom that means  hobby.  The transformation of Kiki's body into a musical instrument with the crude addition of a few brushstrokes makes this a humorous image, but her armless form is also disturbing to contemplate. The title seems to suggest that, while playing the violin was Ingres's hobby, toying with Kiki was a pastime of Man Ray.

He originally decided to go to France to find artistic freedom and kindred spirits. Artists and intellectuals had frequently been his sitters; here, assuming the fashionable trappings of the artist, Man Ray re-positioned himself in that illustrious company.","13 x 9 7 16 in.","Carved walnut, originally partially gilt","Flemish","Pair of Chests","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00138701.jpg","Giuseppe Maggiolini","73.PA.71"

Madame Brunet, the wife of a friend, rejected the painting on account of its perceived ugliness however, and the artist retained it in his studio. He eventually cut off the bottom portion of the canvas, reducing it to a three-quarter-length portrait, and displayed it in his one-man exhibition in Paris in 1867--a show of independence opposite the World's Fair, where more polished examples of society portraiture, like James Tissot'sPortrait of the Marquise de Miramon(also in the Museum's collection), could be seen.","13 x 9 7 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Greek","Christ and the Samaritan Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00071201.jpg","Alessandro Magnasco","78.PA.1"
"1720 - 1730"," One of the most beautiful, strangest, and terrible spectacles one could see is a bullfight,  wrote douard Manet to his friend the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire in 1865. Fascinated by bullfights, Manet here chose to illustrate the violent moment of a bull goring a horse with its horn. While the horse is pinned against the arena, thetorero,dressed in red and still clutching his cape, escapes by jumping over the barrier. Thepicadoror   horse-master  is caught helplessly between his mount and the wall while two spectators try to lift him to safety.Manet probably made this drawing at the scene of an actual bullfight. He used an energetic and gestural line to define the forms for the bodies of the bull and horse. Thin lines of black watercolor delineate the figures, and applied shades of color give three-dimensional form. Touches of yellow, red, blue, and brown animate the crowd of spectators, while economically applied black paint suggests details such as facial features.","13 x 9 7 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Egyptian","Noli Me Tangere","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00071301.jpg","Alessandro Magnasco","78.PA.2"
"1620 - 1630","To commemorate the recent Exposition Universelle, itself a celebration of luxury and prosperity, the French government declared June 30, 1878, a national holiday. The holiday, called theFte de la Paix(Celebration of Peace), also marked France's recovery from the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 and the bloody, divisive Paris Commune that followed. From his second-floor window, douard Manet captured the holiday afternoon with his most precise, staccato brushwork in a patriotic harmony of the reds, whites, and blues of the French flag that waves from the new buildings' windows.The urban street was a principal subject of Impressionist and Modernist painting; many artists aimed to show not only the transformation and growth of the Industrial Age but how it also affected society. Manet's eyes saw both elegant passengers in hansom cabs and, in the foreground, a worker carrying a ladder. The hunched amputee on crutches, perhaps a war veteran or beggar, passes by fenced-in debris left from the construction of a new train track. Manet's sensitivity to the associated costs and sacrifices tempered his optimistic view of national pride and newfound prosperity.","13 x 9 7 16 in.","Oil on canvas","American","Bacchanale","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00073901.jpg","Alessandro Magnasco","88.GA.25"

Two bronze priestesses of the temple of Vesta, the ancient Roman goddess of the hearth and its fire, carry the altar bearing the sacred flame. The sacred flame and the vigilance of the maidens, who kept the altar fire burning continuously, came to symbolize eternity, a suitable association for a timepiece. The theme extends to the hour and minute hands, which are in the form of a snake, another symbol of eternity.The French craftsmen added fine chasing to emphasize decorative details on the pedestal altar, the delicate ritual vessels, and the arabesque patterns on the altar cloth surrounding the clock face. Panels representing Art and Science flank a frieze with cherubs and a goat. Four lounging lions and a marble plinth support the clock.

Melchior, the younger, bearded king behind Caspar, holds a Turkish censer for perfuming the air with incense; on the right, Balthasar the Moor carries a covered cup made of agate.Andrea Mantegna's composition of figures and objects compressed within a shallow space was based on his study of ancient Roman reliefs.

"1917","To emphasize the frenzied violence of the mocking of Christ, Niklaus Manuel Deutsch devised a dynamic radial composition with Christ's luminous, haloed head as the focal point of attacks from all sides. He also included a framing line, to which he wittily called attention by extending the soldier's foot outside its bounds at the bottom.Northern European artists frequently made drawings on colored grounds to be sold to collectors as independent works of art. Manuel Deutsch and such contemporaries as Albrecht Drer and Albrecht Aldorfer employed the technique of drawing on a deeply colored ground with white strokes delineating contours or modeling figures. Ordinarily, they used a sharp quill pen and a fine pointed brush, which they handled with such control that the thinness of its strokes could rival or outstrip those of the pen.For this drawing, the artist prepared a red-brown ground, then drew the scene in black ink. Next he brushed in the lavish whiteheightening, refined additional details in black ink, and touched in Christ's halo with gold pigment.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Encaustic on wood","American","Mummy Portrait of a Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00817101.jpg","Man Ray","86.XM.626.4"
"1919","The stylized clothing of this serene, seated cardinal creates a dramatic pyramidal form. An unbroken conical sweep, the cardinal's vestment or robe extends from his feet to his mask-like face. Covering his forehead, his headdress, known as a miter, functions as the  tip  of the pyramid. The folds in the vestment emphasize the bronze's weight and volume but also create tension and dynamism, enlivening the form. A tiny hand emerges from beneath the garments to remind us that there is a body beneath this powerful bronze cladding. But body and vestment form an indissoluble whole.In the early 1930s, Giacomo Manz visited Rome, where the sight of the Pope flanked by two cardinals in St Peter's Basilica struck him as a singularly timeless image. From the late 1930s to the late 1950s, the sculptor produced more than fifty cardinals--standing and seated, large and small, in bronze, alabastar, and marble. Over this long series, Manz increasingly contained the cardinal figure in rigid compact forms that evoked funerary pyramids or pillars. With only one exception, the cardinals were all conceived without a model, their features invented entirely by the artist.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Self-Portrait Assemblage","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06125201.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.148"
"1920","A man's jacket slung over one shoulder, the cuffs of her shirt cut off with scissors, the Bohemian poet and performer Patti Smith levels her gaze outward with authority and calm. The set of her jaw and lift of her chin suggest she wears confrontation lightly. Simultaneously, a waifish delicacy haunts her tiny body. She touches the ribbon around her neck with long fingers cupped near her heart --a shy gesture and nod to the garb of the 19th-century Romantic poets she admires. With quiet ferocity, the portrait hovers between masculine and feminine, strength and vulnerability.Intimately bonded in life and work, Mapplethorpe and Smith made this image for the cover of her debut rock album,Horses.It is one of his earliest celebrity portraits, a genre in which he went on to distinguish himself. He often amplified the glamour of his subjects, but modernized conventional portrayals with provocative depictions of race, gender, and sexuality. For example, record executives, concerned that Smith with her lack of makeup and messy hair wasn't conventionally pretty enough to sell records like other  girl singers,  wanted to airbrush this image. Knowing Mapplethorpe would back her up, Smith refused and the image and album shaped the start of both their iconoclastic careers.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Duchamp with Water Mill Within Glider","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06123401.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.41"

The composition is disconcerting, as a viewer is uncertain how the vase can balance on the corner of the table, or how exactly the planes of the foreground and background are angled. The resulting image is at once lovely and vaguely unsettling.Mapplethorpe's diverse body of work also included fashion, nudes, portraits, and erotic and sadomasochistic subjects, and is distinguished by an elegant, classical sensibility with an undercurrent of darker complexity.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Marcel Duchamp","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05333701.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.43"

The same elements of glamour and striking simplicity for which he is known in his celebrity and fashion portraiture are visible here, including a tightly cropped composition and uncluttered background that further dramatize the face. Mapplethorpe drew on his early commercial work for magazines, includingVogue. This aspect of his career followed the examples of other noted photographers such as Edward Steichen, Irving Penn, Richard Avedon, and Herb Ritts.His work encompassed portraits, nudes, and still lifes, often with strong erotic, homosexual, and sadomasochistic themes.

The dark shadows of the background seem to lap at his neck, shoulders and under his arms, as if he emerges from a timeless, dark sea. The sophisticated lighting also sculpts the curves of his face, collarbone, and chest to further heighten their elegant forms.This figure study is part of a large body of work featuring African-American men. Mapplethorpe was absorbed by the texture and color of their skin, which he referred to as bronze. He used Agfa's Portriga 118 paper for its ability to produce the velvety texture and glow discernible in this reproduction. His strong, uncluttered compositions of statuesque male models fused a classical sensibility with homoerotic content at a time when the male nude was not a popular subject among camera artists.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Woman Smoking a Cigarette","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05323201.jpg","Man Ray","11 1 16 x 9 in."

There are certain pictures I've taken in which you really can't move that leaf or that hand.--Robert MapplethorpeMapplethorpe presents a tulip, a staple subject of still lifes for centuries, but approaches it in a distinctive way. By choosing to capture the flower in profile, rather than from what would be the intuitive, vertical sightline, Mapplethorpe imbues the image with a sense of motion. The arc of the stem bows below two outstretched leaves, as if floating up or down on wings.After his beginnings with Polaroid portraits, Mapplethorpe refined his style and process in the early 1980s. Drawing on his knowledge of the 19th-century photographs he collected, he used simple compositions and careful lighting to great effect. Considered a central figure in late 20th century photography, his subjects span elegant figure studies, delicate floral still lifes, glamorous celebrity portraits, and the S&M; community.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Untitled Rayograph (Sequins)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05325101.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.152"
"1920","My whole point is to transcend the subject...go beyond the subject somehow, so that the composition, the lighting, all around, reaches a certain point of perfection.--Robert MapplethorpeMapplethorpe's work, whether in his fashion or fine art photography, is distinguished by a tension between opposites. At the base of this image of a calla lily, he punctuates the wide planes of black and white with what seems a decadent surprise: the three-dimensional, curving lip of the flower's edge. He explores the effects of light as a painter might experiment with a palette of colors. At the top, the flower glows milky white, reminiscent of light seen through delicate alabaster or porcelain.Mapplethorpe's spare compositions often showcase familiar subjects in unusual ways. Floral still lifes, for example, have long encouraged sexual interpretations, and especially here, given the artist's other work with erotic and sadomasochistic subjects. His imagination transformed and energized what some had considered a stale genre.","9 3 4 x 6 15 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Tsuguharu Fujita","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05325401.jpg","Man Ray","86.XM.626.7"

While real Greek horses were frequently branded, the mark of the kerykeion appears predominantly in representations of mythological contexts. Given these clues, both drivers probably represent Nike.

Around him hover the stunned onlookers; two women clasp their hands and bow toward him in grief. According to the story, because Tondal's body was still warm, he was not buried. Meanwhile, in his comatose state, Tondal's soul saw  an awful and horrifying multitude of devils who soon invaded the house as well as the air all over the city.  The devils are represented as almost translucent figures penned in gold on the darkness above the onlookers' heads.

According to Greek mythology, Boreas brought Orithyia to Thrace, where the two reigned as King and Queen of the Winds.To decorate the corners of Charles LeBrun's never-completed garden at Versailles, the Parterre d'Eau, Louis XIV commissioned four monumental marble groups representing mythological abductions, each featuring three figures and symbolizing one of the four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. This bronze, with Boreas as a personification of the North Wind representing Air, is based on Marsy's preparatory model for one of these statues. Since the garden was never built as planned, Louis XIV commissioned bronze reductions, or smaller scale copies, of Marsy's work and Franois Girardon's statue to form a pair for his Salon Ovale in the palace of Versailles.

Amphorae filled with oil pressed from olives from the sacred trees of Athena were given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. These amphorae had a special form with narrow neck and foot and a standard fashion of decoration. One side showed Athena, the goddess of war, armed and striding forth between columns, and included the inscription  from the games at Athens.  The other side showed the event for which the vase was a prize. Leading vase-painters, commissioned by the state, decorated these vessels, which continued to be decorated in theblack-figure techniquelong after it had gone out of fashion for other vases, probably due to religious conservatism. The same conservatism is applied to the depiction of Athena.On this example, the figure of Athena is portrayed in anArchaisticor old-fashioned style. An additional inscription, seen here to the right of Athena, names the archon or city magistrate. Because historical records date these magistrates, the vase can be dated very precisely.

The Museum's volume, from about 1480, shows the lasting esteem that theChronicleenjoyed: new copies of the text were still being made about seventy years after the author's death. The book was made inFlanders, perhaps in Bruges. The choice of subjects for the sixty-fourminiaturesstrongly emphasizes events involving the English, evidence perhaps that the book was produced for the English market.

"1933","This large-scale, splendidly illuminated choir book was designed to be seen from the lectern by a group of singers during the Divine Office, the eight prayer services celebrated daily by monks, nuns, and clerics of the Catholic Church. It is the first volume of an antiphonal that probably consisted of seven separately bound books. The manuscript's illumination primarily takes the form of historiated initials marking each of the major holidays of the church year. The illuminator of this manuscript, known as the Master of Gerona, worked in Italy in the late 1200s. Familiar with the most recent trends in Italian panel painting and Byzantine icon painting, he knew how to convey a sense of weight, volume, and depth. Drawing on these innovations, he embedded scenes of surprising naturalism within the initials.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Interior","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05331501.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.6"

Through its windows, the reader sees a man weeping on the lower floor, his two daughters upstairs, and the saint to the right, proffering the necessary gold. Although the legend mentions three daughters, the artist only included two daughters and two gold balls. Saint Nicholas's story became an important theme in art of the late 1200s because the rising costs of dowries in Italy developed into such a burden that contributing to young girls' dowries became a common act of Christian charity.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Three-color carbon transfer print","American","Still Life","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05319501.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.23"

"1936","With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Collage","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05331001.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.53"

The next two scenes tell the story of the Judgment of Solomon. Two women come to Solomon carrying a dead baby and a living one, each claiming the living child as her own.

"1944","Simon de Varie, who served in the French royal treasury under Charles VII and whom the king had recently raised to noble rank, commissioned a book of hours, which was completed in 1455. This richly illuminated private prayer book includes a calendar of church holidays and texts for devotional services inspired by the eight daily services of the divine office. The rise in literacy among the merchant and noble classes and their desire to express a newly emotional personal piety, particularly in veneration of the Virgin Mary, spurred the popularity of books of hours in the 1400s. In their desire for tangible luxury products, many wealthy patrons commissioned sumptuously illuminated books of hours.The complete Varie Hours, of which the Getty Museum's volume is only a part, includes forty-nine large miniatures and several dozen other vignettes and historiated initials by four different artists. While three of these painters are anonymous, Varie commissioned the internationally sought-after painter Jean Fouquet to make six of the manuscript's illuminations; these were appended to the book as an unusual frontispiece. A later owner divided the book into three volumes. The Getty Museum owns one, and the two others belong to the Royal Library in The Hague, The Netherlands.","17 x 13 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Henry Miller and Margaret Neiman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05332201.jpg","Man Ray","84.XM.1000.71"

The dispute between the devil and the saint revolved around the Verses of Saint Bernard; the devil claimed to know seven psalm verses that would ensure salvation when recited every day but said that he would not reveal their identity to Bernard. On hearing this, the saint informed the devil that he would henceforth recite all the psalms every day in order to be sure to say the seven particular verses. The devil was so frightened at the thought of such a display of piety that he immediately revealed the identity of the verses.

Alternatively, they may have once been part of a manuscript, perhaps for this same hospital or monastery.The leaves are the work of the Master of Saint Veronica, one of the most important artists working in Cologne around the year 1400. Throughout the Middle Ages, the city of Cologne on the lower Rhine River was a major artistic center. Cologne's proximity to Dutch and Flemish towns placed it within a nexus of burgeoning artistic creativity, especially in painting and manuscript illumination.

Since the texts of the missal are arranged according to the order in which they were said during the church year, the calendar helped the priest to identify the appropriate prayers for each day. In this missal, the calendar pages are each identified by a zodiacal sign: Aries, indicated by the ram, roughly corresponds to the month of March. The illuminator also included the representation of a Labor of the Month, corresponding to an activity traditionally associated with a particular month. Here a peasant blows two horns, heralding the coming of spring.The illuminations on this page have a distinctive grace and simplicity.

A series of richly colored acanthus leaves forms the shape of the letterAand extends into the margin.In addition to the drolleries, the border decoration originally included the arms of Cosimo de' Migliorati, but these were overpainted with the arms of a later owner of the manuscript, the Antipope John XXIII.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Greek and French","Tulips","www.getty.edu art collections images l 32907701.jpg","Robert Mapplethorpe","2011.7.16"

The eldest king kneels in his fine robes, his crown on the ground as a gesture of humility, while the two other richly adorned kings confer behind. To the left, their attendants hold gifts of ceremonial objects, and above, the star that led the three kings along their journey twinkles in the sky. The miniature marks the introit to the mass said on Epiphany, the feast celebrating the visit of the three Magi to the Christ Child.The representation of the Adoration of the Magi gave illuminators of this period the opportunity to indulge their taste for lavish, fashionable costumes and elaborate ceremonial objects reminiscent of court life. The gold trim of the kings' cloaks contrasts with the simpler clothing of the attendants. In the historiated initial below, two sword-bearers, one dressed in a stylish two-tone outfit, seem to look up into the scene above.

The illuminator expressed the tension of this great drama when the people are first shown the consecrated Eucharist: the worshippers with their varied and animated expressions seem completely caught up in the drama. Adding to the sense that the scene is capturing a specific moment, the standing monks on the left sing from a choir book with open mouths.  The scene takes place in a groin-vaulted Gothic church. The varied poses of the figures, seen in profile, three-quarter view, and from behind, stress their volumetric presence in space. The Master of the Brussels Initials was particularly inventive in the construction of three-dimensional space. This miniature appropriately prefaces the Canon of the Mass, the introduction to the ritual of the Eucharist.

The wounds Christ suffered at the Crucifixion are visible on his chest, hand, and foot, and he carries a banner symbolizing the Resurrection.

In contrast, the nobles in the back are models of temperance: evenly spaced at the orderly table, their bodies rigid, they eat with great sobriety. Through this contrast theilluminatorsuggested that nobles are inherently more temperate, an interpretation that does not derive from the text.

"1470","With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Tiny in Halloween Costume Blowing Bubble, Seattle","www.getty.edu art collections images l 25411601.jpg","Marlay Group","MS. 30"

The layout of the text on the page followed the design used in contemporary Italian printing, and the easily readable humanist script also found its inspiration in Italian manuscripts and printed books.

Froissart recounted that the king, while awaiting his young mistress, called for his bed to be warmed. His servant proceeded in the usual way, but there was a disastrous mishap: the bed caught fire and the king died of his burns several days later. Froissart remained ambiguous about whether the fire was intentionally set, attributing the death to  God or the devils.  The artist communicated the possibility of conspiracy by presentingcourtiersin the room, whispering among themselves while the king burns in his bed. As vivid orange and yellow flames rise around the king's pillows, the figure in tights stands in an elegant dancelike pose that seems utterly inappropriate to the disaster. In his rendering of setting and characters, the artist revealed an interest in observing the natural world. He differentiated textures of wood, stone, and tile and attended to details of the figures that make them convincing as representations of living humans, such as the puffed-up cheeks of the servant blowing his bellows and the carefully modeled anatomy of the king's naked upper body.","12 7 16 x 10 7 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","French","The Beast Acheron","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00237601.jpg","Simon Marmion","MS. 30, FOL. 21V"

"1475","In northeastern France, probably in the area around Noyon, an anonymous artist known as the Master of the Ingeborg Psalter illuminated this psalter shortly after 1205. Almost certainly made for a wealthy layperson for use in private prayer, the book contains the 150 psalms and other poetic texts from the Bible, preceded by a calendar indicating the particular saints and events to be remembered on each day of the year.The book's program of illumination originally consisted of large painted initials at Psalms 1, 26, 38, 51, 52, 68, 80, 97, 101, and 109, dividing the text of the psalms into ten sections. Regrettably, the initial for Psalm 1 was removed from the manuscript long ago and is now lost. The remaining nine initials constitute a stunning display of the achievements of the psalter's illuminator. Many of the initials feature King David, who is often shown acting out the psalm's opening verse.","4 7 8 to 5 1 8 x 18 9 16 x 13 15 16 to 14 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, gold paint, and ink on parchment","French","Two Kings of Ireland","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00238501.jpg","Simon Marmion","MS. 30, FOL. 38V"

"1450 - 1455","With miniatures displaying astounding plays of spatial illusionism, the luxurious personal prayer book known as the Spinola Hours is one of the most visually sophisticated Flemish manuscripts of the sixteenth century. A book of hours contains a calendar of Church holidays, the Hours of the Virgin, which is a cycle of prayer services devoted to the Virgin Mary, the Office for the Dead, and other prayers, hymns, and readings. This particular book augments these contents with a special series of weekday offices and masses, providing even more possibilities for rich illuminations.The Master of James IV of Scotland, while the primary illuminator, collaborated with several other artists to produce the eighty-eight large illuminations in the manuscript. The originality of his work can be seen in the startling illusions present in his miniatures, including such details as paintings of metal pins so real they seem to pierce the parchment. The book was undoubtedly commissioned for a wealthy patron, perhaps Margaret of Austria, for whom The Master of James IV of Scotland produced other works. In the 1700s the book belonged to the Spinola family in Genoa, from whom it takes its modern name.Other artists whose illuminations appear in this manuscript include the Master of the Dresden Prayer Book and the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500.","17 1 2 x 12 1 4 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchmentbound between pasteboard covered with calf","Flemish","Book of Hours","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00171801.jpg","Master of Guillebert de Mets","MS. 2, FOL. 18V"
"1450 - 1455","This leaf depicts a story from the life of Saint Jerome (about 341 - 420), one of the four doctors of the Church. One day, a lion entered the monastery where Jerome resided, causing his fellow monks to flee, but Jerome recognized that the beast was injured and he cured it by removing a thorn from its paw. The saint's monumental form fills the foreground of the composition, setting off the delicate gold tweezers Jerome uses to extract the thorn. In the background, a monk approaches with a pot of ointment and a bandage. The encounter between man and animal, in which Jerome comes to the lion's aid, is poignant, showing the moment when the lion submits to the saint, the saint's concentration as he removes the thorn, and the apprehensiveness of the attendant monk.This cutting likely represents a large miniature or initial from a gradual probably commissioned for the Camaldolese monastery of San Mattia in Murano. This manuscript was one of the most lavish and elaborately illuminated Lombard choir book commissions of the fifteenth century. The artist responsible for its decoration it is known as the Master of the Murano Gradual. This illuminator likely worked between the regions of Lombardy and the Veneto and he is notable for his originality and his imposing figures clothed in voluminous drapery, their faces strongly modeled and expressive.","16 11 16 x 10 1 4 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, and gold paint on parchment","Flemish","Saint Veronica Displaying the Sudarium","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00296201.jpg","Master of Guillebert de Mets","MS. 2, FOL. 37V"

Froissart also described the affairs of other realms, though largely as they related to the complex network of overlapping and shifting alliances around England and France.The Getty Museum'smanuscriptcontains the third of four books; its 730 pages cover only the period from 1358 to 1389, an indication of the level of detail Froissart sought to impart. The Museum's volume, from about 1480, shows the lasting esteem that theChronicleenjoyed: new copies of the text were still being made about seventy years after the author's death. The book was made inFlanders, perhaps in Bruges. The choice of subjects for the sixty-fourminiaturesstrongly emphasizes events involving the English, evidence perhaps that the book was produced for the English market.

"1510 - 1520","In the early 1400s in the northern Netherlands, a new dynamic cultural circle developed under the patronage of Albrecht of Bavaria, Count of Holland. In a workshop closely associated with the count, the anonymous artists known as the Masters of Dirc van Delf illuminated this book of hours, perhaps for a member of Albrecht's family or one of his courtiers. These artists, who worked in the International style that so appealed to aristocratic taste across Europe, formed one of the first important illuminators' workshops of fifteenth-century Holland.While the Hours of the Virgin were most often illustrated with miniatures showing the Life of the Virgin, this book illustrates these services with scenes from the Passion of Christ. With their powerful dramatic style, the eight full-page miniatures provide visual meditations on the meaning of the story of Jesus, fostering the viewer's empathy for his supreme sacrifice. Historiated initials and decorated borders complete the decorative scheme.","14 5 16 x 18 11 16 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Gardening; Zodiacal Sign of Aries","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00419401.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

On the right, soldiers muscle in to arrest Jesus.Pushing, gesturing soldiers on one side and Peter's upraised sword on the other overlap the image's frame. The artist crowded the composition in this way to heighten the scene's emotion and tension. Collapsed at the miniature's bottom edge, the figure of Malchus plays an important role, extending the pictorial space into the unpainted margin and drawing the viewer into the painting in this tiny book.","1 ft. 4 15 16 in. x 1 ft. 1 3 16 in. x 5 5 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Farm Animals, Milking, and Buttermaking; Zodiacal Sign of Taurus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00419501.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

The theme of the Madonna of Humility became popular in the 1400s as Christians increasingly focused on the human qualities of holy figures. The artist(s) further emphasized the Virgin's humanity by representing her nursing the infant Jesus.The rubric,Incipiunt hore de domina n[ost]ra(The hours of our Lady begin), introduces the Matins text of the Hours of the Virgin, which begins with a verse from Psalm 50:Domine labia mea aperies et os meum annunciabit laude[m] tuam(Lord, open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise).

Within this context, the miniature of Christ before Pilate serves as a visual focus for the prayers that follow. Pilate, the Roman prefect in Jerusalem who presided at Jesus' trial and gave the order for his Crucifixion, sits on a throne. Jesus' sad but patient expression suggests his acceptance of his fate.This confrontation between Pilate and Christ takes place within a shallow architectural setting much like a stage, with a flat, curtainlike, gold-patterned background behind. But the shallow space cannot contain the corporeal figures, who stand in front of the miniature's frame so that the figure of Jesus is presented both to Pilate and to the viewer. The solid weight of the figures and the frame contrasts with the delicacy of the fine sprays of leaves and flowers extending from the frame.","11 5 16 x 9 1 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Sheepshearing; Zodiacal Sign of Cancer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00419701.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

The tender assistance of the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist draws attention to Jesus' wounds, stimulating the viewer's meditation on his sacrifice. His wounds are graphically rendered as open gashes dripping with blood. The saturated primary colors of the frame and draperies further set off Jesus' pale, emaciated body. Behind the figures, the pink cross picks up the faint, glowing hues of his suffering body. The full-page Lamentation appears within a sequence of images retelling the Passion story in this book of hours, the most popular type of private devotional manuscript of the later Middle Ages. The miniature of the Virgin and John mourning over the body of Jesus was particularly appropriate to a culture interested in devotional practices. Inspired by a burgeoning literature describing his torments, pious individuals increasingly focused their meditations on Jesus' suffering.","11 3 8 x 8 15 16 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Mowing; Zodiacal Sign of Leo","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00419801.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

The figures' broad forms extend beyond the confines of the painted frame, blurring the distinction between the miniature's and the viewer's space. The viewer is thus invited into the scene, especially by the figure on the right, who turns in toward Jesus in a position analogous to that of the observer.While the artist created naturalistic, three-dimensional figures and a seemingly weighty sculpted sarcophagus, he still placed them before a traditional flat pattern of small, colored squares or diamonds, an abstract design called a diapered ground.","13 1 2 x 10 7 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Reaping; Zodiacal Sign of Virgo","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00419901.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

The exposition was a great success, attracting more than six million visitors during the five months that it was open to the public. The impressive structure, consisting of an intricate network of slender iron rods sustaining walls of glass, was built expressly for the exposition and was not intended to be permanent. The main body of the building was 1,848 feet (563 m) long and 408 feet (124 m) wide; the centraltranseptwas 108 feet (33 m) high. The Crystal Palace established an architectural standard for later international exhibitions, several of which were likewise housed in glass conservatories.John Jabez Edwin Mayall may have made this daguerreotype from the second tier in order to encompass the scale of the building.

Through the coaxing of either Madame Daguerre or Daguerre's niece, Meade secured the sitting. Daguerre's reticence, however, is apparent; he looks a bit uneasy and anxious for the whole ordeal to be over.During that visit Meade made five portraits of Daguerre, which he later exhibited in the galleries that were part of the Meade Studios in New York.

They interpret this scene as a mythical parallel for the tyrant Peisistratos's return from exile, when he was able to regain power because the Athenian army was unprepared for battle. If so, then these vases would be anti-Peisistratid propaganda, alerting Athenians to the importance of vigilance by reminding them of the consequences of their recent failure.The back of the vase shows a warrior departing for battle, standing between two old men.

"1510 - 1520","Johann Gottlieb Kirchner produced the model for this life-size porcelain sculpture of a fox-looking a little guiltily around the chicken it is about to devour-as part of an extraordinary commission from Augustus the Strong, elector of Saxony and king of Poland, who envisioned a life-size porcelain menagerie for his Japanese Palace in Dresden. The Meissen Porcelain Manufactory had been operating for only twenty years when Augustus commissioned this series of porcelain animals to be rendered  in their natural sizes and colors.  The production of porcelain models of this size had never been attempted before in Europe.Some of the technical difficulties Kirchner encountered in fulfilling this commission are evident on this figure of a fox with a chicken. First, the large scale of the figure required a number of highly visible vent holes to prevent explosions in the kiln. Second, shrinkage during the firing process and strong downward pressure from the objects' own weight caused cracks of varying severity. Meissen craftsmen tried numerous ways to reduce cracking; though they were certainly very inventive, few methods worked. The cracks made a final firing with enamel colors impossible, since this would have shattered the already cracked figures. Some were painted in oil colors, which became dull and discolored. In most cases the paint was removed at a later date. Traces of paint can be seen inside the pricked ears of this fox. In many ways, the successful creation of this life-size fox with a chicken attests to the Meissen manufactory's diligent attempt to satisfy one of the richest and most powerful men of the time.","9 7 16 x 7 1 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Adoration of the Magi","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00423101.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

Though he had already amassed an unrivaled collection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain, Augustus wanted these new figures to be produced by his own factory at Meissen. When Augustus placed the order for these porcelain animals, the Meissen factory was still of very limited experience, having only discovered the formula forhard-paste porcelainabout twenty years prior. The figure was modeled by Johan Joachim Kndler, a sculptor who was hired by the manufactory in 1731 to assist with the commission for the animalsProducing such large figures presented a number of challenges for Kndler and the Meissen craftsmen. The clay's thickness and weight and uneven shrinking frequently caused the animals to crack and collapse in the kiln. This turkey, along with all other sculptures for Augustus, was originally meant to be painted in the animal's natural colors; however, doing so proved technically impossible. Despite these difficulties, the figures stand as important examples of an early and experimental aspect of ceramic art.","H:  1 ft. 9 in. x W:  2 ft. 1 1 8 in. x D:  9 1 4 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Flagellation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00423201.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

According to myth, Aphrodite fell in love with the beautiful mortal youth Adonis. Shortly after, he was killed in a hunting accident. Aphrodite was so distraught thatZeus, the king of the gods, made Adonis immortal, allowing him to leaveHades, the underworld of the dead, for part of the year to be with Aphrodite. He always, however, had to return to Hades, where he was Persephone's lover. This cycle of death and rebirth was linked with the regeneration of vegetation and the crop seasons in ancient Greece. Originating in theNear East, the cult of Adonis was introduced to Athens in about 440 B.C.; its devotees were exclusively female.The other side of the krater's neck shows a scene from asymposium, or drinking party, in which three male couples recline on couches. On the sides of the stand, a scene ofDionysosreclining with attendants mirrors the scene with Adonis above. A hunt scene with real and mythological animals covers the top of the stand.The form of this monumental vase, a volute-krater resting on a separately made stand, is exceptional. The combination of ribbing on the body of the vase andred-figuredecoration is quite rare in Athenian pottery. Indeed, many aspects of this vase are more typical of the Greek colonies in South Italy than in Athens, perhaps indicating that this vase was meant to look South Italian or even made for export to that area.","15 13 16 x 12 7 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Crucifixion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00423801.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

"1450s","The Vexed Manis one of a series of 69 portrait busts or  character heads  made by Franz Xaver Messerschmidt, an eighteenth-century German sculptor active in Austria. Messerschmidt sculpted them during the last thirteen years of his life, while apparently suffering from mental illness.This bust portrays a middle-aged man with a sour expression, which seems to fall somewhere between a grimace and a scowl. The most telling aspect may be the furrowed brow above squinting eyes and a scrunched nose. But natural cracks in the bust's alabaster surface seem to echo the topography of his skin, both softened by age yet hardened by the extreme expression. The man's receding hairline, wrinkles, and sagging jawline contrast with tensed cheek and neck muscles. Although the character seems to express irritation and annoyance, it is not certain whether Messerschmidt intended that interpretation, because he did not give the bust a title.This bust and the series it belongs to reflect the intellectual concerns of artists and scholars during the Enlightenment era, when a surge of interest in the sciences occurred. Studies in physiognomy were highly popular at the time. Perhaps as influential was Messerschmidt's undiagnosed mental condition, which could have been schizophrenia. A contemporary wrote that Messerschmidt told him that by making the character heads, he hoped to ward away spirits that invaded his mind.","10 ft. 7 in. x 9 ft. 11 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","French","The Crucifixion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11038001.jpg","Master of the Berlin Crucifixion","MS.

These wide eyes and the intense expression evoke the pathos of tradition devotional images of Christ being led to his death, mocked, scourged, and finally crucified.Meunier's loose, sketch-like handling of the bronze, however, is thoroughly modern, reminiscent of Auguste Rodin's manner. To suggest the horizontal arms of the cross, Meunier extended the shoulders out to the sides; he also detached at the wrist the left hand that crosses the chest, leaving it as a particularly evocative fragment. The bust's truncation is similarly radical, with a jagged, cut-off edge ending in a massive, irregular base. Artists in the 1800s came to use this kind of jagged truncation as a symbol for the alienated artist. Here Meunier applied the symbolic content of the jagged cut to a traditional religious representation, expressing the idea that Christ was cast out by those whom he would redeem.","13 ft. 9 in. x 6 ft. 3 in.","10 3 8 x 7 1 4 in.","French","The Throne of Grace Trinity","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00388401.jpg","Master of Jean de Mandeville","MS. 1, V1, FOL. 1"
"1360 - 1370","The fine rendering in this watercolor by Hendrik Meyer underscores his subject: an idealized version of summer in the Dutch countryside. In theforeground, a tree and a shepherd tending sheep are cast in deep shadow. Their silhouettes draw attention to a brightly lit mill house in which every brick, piece of wood, and blade of straw is visible. Beyond the mill an ivy-covered steeple, a field, and a village are, by contrast, much more pale to establish atmospheric distance. Other details suggest the summer heat: Women are barefoot, a dog drinks water from the mill's stream, and cattle gravitate toward the shade. Much of the scene is animated: Men tend to animals or reap hay; womenwash, spin wool, and chatter; animals wander about; birds soar above, and a frothy waterfall spills from the mill.Meyer's figured landscapes were produced as finished works for sale. They revived a seventeenth-century tradition of such scenes, hearkening back to Dutch painters such as Pieter Bruegel the Elder, as well as calendar illustrations in medievalbooks of hours.

A barren tree rendered in crisp lines and white highlights, dominates the foreground. The sky is filled with gray clouds, smoke pours from a cottage chimney, and a nearby stream is frozen over. A partially submerged rowboat is covered with snow and ice. Despite the frigid weather, people are outside, keeping warm with activities such as chopping and gathering wood, sledding, and ice-skating. Other elements in the scene also suggest movement: a windmill, chimney smoke, and birds circling or flying in formation.

To the right, a lightly drawn donkey grazes; the angels are barely discernible at the top left. The focus of attention, however, is the central group of the Virgin and the two children.Michelangelo achieved a solid, sculptural effect by using a combination of different media drawn on top of each other: underdrawing with a stylus, black and then red chalk, followed by pen and brown ink. Finely modulated hatching and cross-hatching enhances the figures' sense of three-dimensionality. Changes reflecting Michelangelo's creative working methods are visible in the head of the Virgin, which is positioned simultaneously looking downwards to the left and upwards to the right.","4 ft. 7 1 2 in. x 2 ft. 9 in. x 1 ft. 3 3 4 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","French","The Expulsion from Paradise","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00289201.jpg","Master of Jean de Mandeville","MS. 1, V1, FOL. 39"

"1360 - 1370","Francesco Paolo Michetti chose to title this drawingScherzoto reflect the intention behind his self-portrait. To express the idea of ascherzo, a sprightly musical composition or movement, Michetti applied his materials in a quick, gestural manner that conjures up the music's darting, skipping rhythms. The brilliance of Michetti's color, particularly the halo of white around his face, also evokes thescherzo's liveliness. During the later 1800s, many artists believed in a concept known assynesthesia: that color and sound were so closely related that color could stimulate the sensation of sound and sound could stimulate the sensation of color.At age twenty-six, in the same year that one of his pictures received great public acclaim, Michetti drew multiple self-portraits.

Around her neck she wears a mask on a chain, which may refer to art's ability to deceive through the art of illusion.Frans van Mieris the Elder adopted the antique model ofPicturabut updated it for his time.

In this theatrical painting, John Everett Millais depicted a sixteenth-century scene of a father paying ransom for his two daughters.The subject matter and technique are typical of the Pre-Raphaelite movement founded by Millais. Although he wanted to express a moral seriousness in his work, the drama is unconvincing: the figures are stiff and too large for the room they inhabit.The Ransomreceived criticism of this kind when it was exhibited, but no one could find fault with Millais's painting technique. The sharp, near-photographic rendering of objects, materials, and individuals display Millais's technical brilliance.Millais's painting was a group effort of sorts. His mother made and designed the costumes, his friend Mr. Miller posed for the head of the knight and he drew the body from a gigantic railway guard named  Strong.  The girls were painted from one model, Miss Helen Petrie, and Major McBean posed as one of the kidnappers. The artist, however, did not much care for the painting and referred to it as  the picture with the dreadful blue-and-white page in the corner.

The subtle tonal variations of the platinum print convey the flower's and bud's distinct, tactile qualities. As the viewer's eyes move upward, the flower's dark stem gives way to smooth, light petals that bend back gracefully, becoming translucent at the tips. The closed bud, however, displays the slightly irregular texture of the petals, and, unlike the open flower, appears darkest at the tips. For Modotti, who described nature as innocent, mysterious, and erotic, the contrast between the open, light flower and the closed, dark bud may have symbolized her own emotional state.","18 15 16 x 15 3 16 in.","Pen and black ink","Italian","A Flutist and Drummer Before a Moated Castle","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00023501.jpg","Master of the Brussels Initials","MS. 34, FOL. 6V"

Monet's technique is also apparent in the use of light to animate the surfaces of the flowers, fruit, and tablecloth and in the way the colors are affected by the light, by reflections, and by each other.

He said,  For me a landscape hardly exists at all as a landscape, because its appearance is constantly changing; but it lives by virtue of its surroundings, the air and the light which vary continually. After beginning outdoors, Monet reworked each painting in his studio to create the color harmonies that unify each canvas. The pinks in the sky echo the snow's reflections, and the blues of the wheatstacks' shadows are found in the wintry light shining on the stacks, in the houses' roofs, and in the snowy earth. With raised, broken brushstrokes, Monet captured nuances of light and created a solid, geometric structure that prevents the surface from simply melting into blobs. The wheatstacks are solid forms, and, while the outlying houses are indecipherable close-up, they are clear from a distance.","7 1 8 x 5 1 4 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial T: The Healing of the Blind after Touching the Body of Saint Anthony","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00440701.jpg","Master of the Brussels Romulon","MS.

He painted there in late winter in both 1892 and 1893, then reworked his thirty canvases from memory in the studio through 1894. He began this example in 1893, working in an improvised studio in the front room of a dressmaker's shop across from the cathedral.After creating a coherent ensemble, Monet selected twenty paintings that he considered  complete  and  perfect,  including this one, for an exhibition at his Paris dealer's gallery in May 1895.

They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.","7 15 16 x 6 1 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial Q: The Ship of Bishop Theophile with the Reliquary Shrine before the City of Sousa","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00441101.jpg","Master of the Brussels Romulon","MS.

"1480 - 1483","Although willfully distorted, this large bronze form remains instantly identifiable as a seated woman. The figure's lower half has been reduced to a bulbous mass that rests atop a minimally articulated stool. The top half is more contorted, yet plainly recognizable as a female torso. The woman's head turns distractedly to one side and, though lacking in anatomical specificity, achieves a surprising degree of expression.The creation of this sculpture reveals the lengthy gestation period that sometimes accompanied Henry Moore's work. In the late 1950s, he made amaquetteor small plaster model of this seated figure. Once he had achieved the desired shape, one of Moore's studio assistants then carved a plaster mold of themaquetteto be sent to a foundry for casting in bronze. But Moore, unsatisfied with the large mold, chose not to have it cast and continued to refine the plaster. It remained in his studio for many years and was finally cast in 1975--more than two decades after the original design was conceived.","3 3 8 x 2 3 16 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Flemish","Duke William of Gelders and Richard II","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00483201.jpg","Master of the Copenhagen Caesar","MS.

"1480 - 1483","Composed of swelling masses, the reclining mother tenderly cradles her small child. Drapery largely conceals the massive figure's anatomy, but a clearly delineated arm forms a protective right angle around the stiff, inert baby. The mother's eyes--the only feature of her otherwise blank face--stare unblinkingly outward at the viewer. A rich, golden surface, punctuated by bright highlights and dark caverns, enhances the sculpture's warm, protective quality. The horizontal form's hollows and curves, tarnished and hatched to emphasize depth, partly transform the figure into a glimmering, rolling landscape.This work combines several themes that preoccupied Henry Moore: the reclining figure, the relationship of mother and child, and the landscape. Moore began exploring the reclining figure motif in a series of drawings he made in the late 1920s--nearly sixty years before creating this sculpture. Despite his continued interest in this subject, the sculptor resisted attaching any specific or symbolic meaning to it. Instead, he insisted that the reclining figure was simply a formal vessel--a pose he understood and greatly appreciated-- that allowed him to explore questions of form.","3 7 16 x 2 3 16 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Flemish","John of Gaunt Giving a Letter from the Duke of Berry to a Messenger","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00484201.jpg","Master of the Copenhagen Caesar","MS.

I have never been tempted to remain a purely abstract sculptor.  This sculpture had its origins in a group of drawings created by the artist almost fifty years earlier. In the mid-1930s, Moore made a series of sketches based on carved wood figures from the South Pacific. Around 1940, he began to transform this imagery into three-dimensions, creating a series of helmet-encased heads.Bronze Formis directly related to this theme and was completed only a year before the artist's death.","10 1 4 x 8 1 8 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Flemish","John of Gaunt Receiving the Messenger of the Duke of Berry","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00484301.jpg","Master of the Copenhagen Caesar","MS. 80, VERSO"

Such a suit was designed for the  foot tourney,  a combat in which two men faced one another over a wooden barrier and struck each other with a prescribed number of blows from a pike or sword. The armor was probably made in southern Germany, but officers from Austria, Spain, and parts of Italy would have sought it out. Soldiers always wore their sword on the opposite side of its primary use; thus this man's rapier, hanging from his right side, demonstrates that he is left-handed.The artist may have adopted this three-quarter-length, three-quarter-view format from Titian, who introduced the composition in military portraits in the 1530s. As court painter to King Philip II of Spain, Mor painted many such portraits of members of the Spanish court and the Habsburg family.

This scene shows the dramatic climax from the eighth labor of Hercules, who was ordered to capture the four flesh-eating horses belonging to King Diomedes. Hercules killed the king in battle and fed his body to the horses, which tamed them. Gustave Moreau's fascination with violent, emotionally charged subjects portrayed in jewel-like colors typifies mid-1800s French painting. Here Moreau's luminous and delicately applied watercolor washes enhance an already dramatic scene, highlighting the vertical body of the doomed Diomedes, whose extended, stretched limbs repeat the dynamic rearing motion of the brown horse's front legs.

Indeed, the two figures resemble dancers performing a ballet rather than opponents struggling for sexual conquest. With its jagged mountains, the hazy, mysterious landscape provides an eerie background. Moreau was not interested in presenting detailed information about the setting or its elements; he chose instead to disintegrate forms, allowing them to give way to areas of color that suggest shapes.He meant to includeDejanirain a set of pictures representing the changing seasons; the painting's autumnalpaletteof reds, oranges, browns, dark greens, and creamy whites conveys its other title,Autumn. Moreau described what he had in mind to the painting's first owner:I have tried to render the harmony that may exist between the world of nature at a certain time of year and certain phases of human life.

Her left arm is bare and raised: in her languor and dishevelment, she displays a sexual availability ordinarily reserved for private eyes.A black woman sits at the end of the sofa, looking bored and distrustful while cradling her mistress's bracelet-topped feet in one hand and resting the other on her calf. Thebackgroundbehind the two women has been cut out, presumably to heighten the visual impact by focusing attention on the sitters.A convention of Orientalist imagery, the subject of the sexually available female attended by a black maid subscribed to a stereotyped fantasy of non-European women.

Amazingly, the original loose-fitting lid, painted with a matching miniature coat of arms, still survives unbroken. A fanciful arrangement of arabesques topped by female busts frames the arms on the front, while the figure of Neptune with a dolphin is centered on the back.

This jar was produced in Moustiers, at one of the most important and influential of the French faience factories, which was run by the Clrissy family.In 1689 and 1709, Louis XIV ordered the French nobility to turn in all their silver, which was then melted down to pay for debts accumulated by the king during his numerous wars. As a direct result of these laws, faience, tin-glazed earthenware, became popular as a replacement for silver in upper-class households.","2 1 4 x 16 5 16 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial P: Saint Peter and the Conversion of Saint Paul","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00276001.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 197"

But the godMercurywas also traditionally depicted wearing a helmet, so other scholars now believe that the figures may represent Mercury and thenymphLara. In fact, the scene closely resembles a print that Muller engraved of Mercury and Lara.Muller's sure yet delicate contours define both god and nymph with a few simple strokes. Strong pen lines define the outlines of their bodies, while quick flicks of ink suggest the dimpled curves on stomachs, buttocks, and thighs.

The color blue conveys the mysticism and melancholy of the landscape, which seems full of premonitions. An abstract mound at the right represents a clump of trees; a white fence runs diagonally in front. The vaguely defined shape on the fence may be a shadow of two lovers, a recurring theme in Munch's work. He used an undulating line to depict the shoreline that continues into the trees at the right. Stars reflect in the water, and a flash of light in the trees shines brightly.Varying thicknesses of blue and green paint are blended together to form the impression of a night sky.

Orpheus sits in the center of the drawing focused on his music, while around him birds perch overhead, a frog, lizard, and pair of doves crouch at his feet, and horses, deer, an elephant, a goat, and a unicorn draw near.Josias Murer belonged to a family of Swiss glass-painters who worked in and around Zurich in the late 1500s. Scholars know that he produced this drawing as a design for a stained-glass panel, since Murer left a blank border around the composition. No panel with this illustration still survives.The theme of Orpheus charming the animals was one of the most popular among artists living in Northern Europe in the 1500s and 1600s. During this era of intense political upheaval and religious strife, the story came to express the hope in the power of art and poetry to conquer, and even resolve, irreconcilable conflict.","19 5 8 x 29 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial A: Saint Adrian","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00276501.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 202"

The bearded old man expresses devotion to God through a heavenward gaze and a pious gesture. The painter, Bartolom Esteban Murillo, contrasted the saint's humble presence with a brilliant, spiritual vision and a miracle he performed during his lifetime.Murillo combined a realistic approach with an expressive manipulation of paint to underscore this unity of the earthly and the spiritual. The painting is mostly rendered in subdued, earthy tones. But a soft, intense glow infuses the wordCharitas(Charity), bathing five hoveringputtiand the saint in awashof golden light.

This bold drafting style, expressed in extremely loose, staccato penstrokes, gives energetic freedom to a standard religious subject. In contrast to the sentimentality and usually smooth brushwork of his paintings, Murillo's drawings display fluidity and spontaneity.Known and admired for his idealized portrayals of children, Murillo often drew and painted scenes of the infancy of Christ, here identified by a shepherd's staff. This attribute also identifies the source of the subject, a passage in the Gospel of Saint John:  I am the good shepherd who gives his life for his sheep.

Using spare contours and pale washes, he created the long cloak that covers the body of the monk; his small, round head; and the straight lines of the cross. Faint shadows extend out from either foot, as well as from the small winged putto holding an empty escutcheon in the left corner, giving both figures an impression of depth.Scholars guess that the monk may be San Diego de Henares de Alcal, a Spanish lay brother of the Capuchin order who died in 1463. San Diego was sent with missionaries to the Canary Islands and was canonized by Philip II of Spain. The king prayed to him when his son lay dying and, out of gratitude for the boy's recovery, asked the pope to make him a saint. Artists often drew San Diego carrying a cross or with the infant Jesus Christ in his arms.","3 ft. 7 in. x 1 ft. 5 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial S: The Stigmatization of Saint Francis","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00277001.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 207"

He achieved increased contrast by blocking out the sky area withpigmentand bleaching the deeply shaded section under the roof to more clearly show the mosque interior.The waxed-paper process was particularly useful for traveling photographers like Murray because the paper did not require immediate development. It also offered more translucency than other commonly used negatives. The process involved rubbing wax into the paper negative before it was sensitized and exposed. The wax created a smooth surface and reduced the blurring effects of paper fibers. Both the negative and the final print display great clarity of detail, as in the piercings of the surrounding wall and the outlines of distant buildings.","H:  3 ft. 7 1 4 in. x W:  1 ft. 5 1 2 in. x D:  1 ft. 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial G: Mary Magdalene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00277101.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 208V"

The length of each stride may be calculated by the line of consecutive numbers arranged parallel with the track, a number being placed every 12 inches of distance.--Eadweard J. MuybridgeThe possibility for moving pictures originated from a rich man's bet: whether or not a galloping horse ever had all four feet off the ground at any time during its stride. Because the unaided eye cannot see such an instantaneous event, Leland Stanford hired Eadweard Muybridge to photograph his racehorse, Occidental. After Muybridge produced the proof to win the bet, he continued his motion experiments and documented them in this album. He wrote the above passage on the album's first page, describing his methodical approach of rigging twenty-four cameras with electromagnetic shutters--tripped by wires as an animal ran across a track.Photographs of the cameras show how wires were attached to modified lens shutters; others depict the racetrack, where a long shed with the battery of cameras faced a track with a wall behind to silhouette subjects. Most pages depict animals and humans walking, running, and jumping before the cameras. Muybridge later devised the zoopraxiscope, a rotating device that animated sequences of images.","2 3 4 x 3 7 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial G: Saint Catherine","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00277201.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 13V"
"1480 - 1485","As the story goes, in 1872 railroad magnate and ex-governor of California Leland Stanford made a bet with a fellow horseman regarding a horse's gallop. Contending that all four of a horse's feet are off the ground simultaneously at some point while galloping, Stanford hired Muybridge to prove it photographically.Muybridge's first photographs of the horse were poorly exposed and thus inconclusive. After constructing a more efficient shutter and improving the speed of his film, he resumed his experiments with motion studies in 1877, but he was still producing only single images. Undaunted, he developed a system of first twelve and eventually twenty-four cameras, whose electro-magnetic shutter blades were opened by the stride of the animal tripping wires strung across the track. This series of twenty-four consecutive frames, which took less than one second to expose, was made after Muybridge had perfected his technique. Ultimately, Muybridge did prove that all four feet of a galloping horse were off the ground simultaneously.","2 1 2 x 2 5 16 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Initial G: Saint Barbara","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00277301.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 50V"

Inexpensive multiples offered for public sale, they often featured portraits of celebrities of the day--writers, musicians, actors--and were widely collected. Nadar's photograph ofSarahBernhardt (French, 1844-1923) as Phdre is from a collector's album of cabinet card portraits of Bernhardt by various photographers.A famous actress in the late 1800s, the  Divine Sarah  was a brilliant self-promoter at a time when the basis of celebrity was shifting from the political figure to the theatrical performer. Bernhardt pioneered the use of new technologies to disseminate her image: she was one of the most photographed women in the world, and the first major stage actress to star in films. She made several recordings of famous theatrical dialogues including a reading from Racine's Phdre at Thomas Edison's home.A recognizable figure, Bernhardt--often depicted in theatrical costume--endorsed commercial products. Contemporary with this cabinet card, her image appeared on cigarette cards, an early form of product promotion. Advertisements as well as collectable ephemera, cigarette cards like cabinet cards, reinforced Bernhardt's image in popular culture.","49 1 2 x 39 1 4 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Visitation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097001.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 96V"

Nadar's photograph was probably the first of innumerable images by painters, photographers, sculptors, and graphic artists. At a time when Nadar was preoccupied with ballooning and willing to leave most of the portrait work to studio assistants, Bernhardt drew him back into the studio to make touching images of her delicate face. Here he wrapped her with a great sweep of velvet that bared one shoulder but showed no more of her slender body, centering all attention on her head, which is seen nearly in profile.The young woman with the supple shoulders and the golden voice became an incomparable and indomitable actress, famous first in France and then throughout the world for playing heroines-and heroes-in a wide variety of plays.

"1480 - 1485","When the poet, playwright, and novelist Victor Hugo died in 1885, Nadar went to his deathbed to make a final image as a memorial of the great man. Nadar's sketch of the death chamber showed that black drapery was tied across a window behind the bed and then to one of the bedposts in order to visually isolate Hugo's recumbent figure against a somber background. For the photograph, a mirror reflected light back from the window to provide detail in the shadow area.During the 1800s, Hugo was thought to be France's greatest writer. He began to write while still a schoolboy, and his poetry was first published at twenty. His wildly popular novels soon followed. Hugo's troubled personal life, however, stood in sharp contrast to his successful career. His wife was conspicuously in love with another man, his favorite daughter drowned, and another went mad. A talented amateur artist, he was interested in photography and once contemplated illustrating a book of his poems with photographic negatives. By the time of his death, Hugo was revered: his body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe, and he was buried in the Panthon. Paul Nadar made this print in the 1920s from his father's negative of 1885.","14 3 4 x 11 5 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Annunciation to the Shepherds","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097201.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 106V"
"1480 - 1485","Often referred to as the prince of critics, theater critic, novelist, and literary historian Jules Janin was an amazingly prolific French writer of the mid-1800s, now all but forgotten. In conversation he attributed his forty-year success to his having changed his mind every fifteen days, thus continuing to surprise the attentive audience of his weekly theatrical reviews.Scholars are undecided regarding the authorship of this portrait. For a brief period, Nadar and his brother Adrien Tournachon worked together in the latter's studio in the boulevard des Capucines. Three photographs of Janin wearing these clothes appear to have been made at a single sitting during this period. The three prints suggest a sequence of events in which Janin posed first for Adrien, then for both Adrien and Nadar, and then finally for Nadar alone. Janin's expression becomes progressively less friendly, perhaps due to a quarrel between him and Nadar or perhaps because his gout was troubling him. Nadar inscribed this print with Janin's name; it is probably the middle picture in the series, made by the brothers in collaboration.","8 7 16 x 10 3 4 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Adoration of the Magi","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097301.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 114V"
"1480 - 1485","Nadar made numerous self-portraits, which allowed him to experiment with poses and gestures before turning the camera on his illustrious subjects. The writer Charles Baudelaire's homage,  Nadar, the most astonishing expression of vitality,  applies easily to the intense young man gazing coyly but self-assuredly at a point just above the lens of his own camera.Perhaps Nadar was merely looking at an assistant helping to make the exposure, but he clearly intended to project an image of himself as the intense,Romanticartist. His left hand braces his body against the chair, while his right hand, cradling his chin and holding up his head, echoes the gesture of his left to create pictorial balance.This photograph was taken at mid-career; Nadar was already a celebrated writer,caricaturist, and portrait photographer. He was thus free to play with self-representation, exploring the many personas that made up a complex and talented man.","7 x 8 11 16 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Presentation in the Temple","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097401.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 121V"

This portrait was made when Nadar was just starting out as a photographer, either just after his and Ernestine's engagement or just after their wedding. Ernestine Lefvre was eighteen years old to Nadar's thirty-four; she was a middle-class girl from Normandy, and he was a bohemian Parisian artist who socialized with painters, writers, and actors. Whatever her thoughts were when this portrait was made, their relationship was apparently a successful one: they had been married for fifty-four years at Ernestine's death.","6 15 16 x 9 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Massacre of the Innocents","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097501.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS. 23, FOL. 146V"
"1480 - 1485","A favorably disposed nineteenth-century critic described the fiery sculptor Antoine Augustin Prault thus:  The fever of poetry, the drunkenness of beauty, the horror of vulgarity, and the madness of glory possessed and tormented Prault.  Nadar's portrait captured the sculptor's turbulent energy through the tense twist of the pose. Prault's body turns to his right, his head slightly to the left, and his eyes farther to his left. His folded arms wrap around his body, momentarily holding in check his considerable physical and intellectual power, the better to be unleashed.By using strong overhead diagonal light to shape the large dome of the head and to cast half the face into shadow, Nadar emphasized the gravity of Prault's presence. Sitter and photographer produced a portrait that reveals the essence of the man rather than merely his appearance.","8 13 16 x 11 7 16 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Flight into Egypt","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097601.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS.

"1510 - 1520","That Nadar was able to persuade theRomanticpoet Madame Desbordes-Valmore to sit for him at the very beginning of his career as a photographer had much to do with the reputation he had earlier gained as acaricaturistof literary and artistic circles. Her career, to which she had been late in coming, was nearly over. Although her name is now obscure, she was a well-known poet in her day, highly praised by her peers.When Nadar photographed her, Desbordes-Valmore was sixty-eight. She came to the studio somewhat reluctantly, citing her age and  the cruelty of the sun.  The resigned sadness of her weathered face bespoke not only climate but also the difficulties of her eventful life and the deaths of her brother, two sisters, two daughters, and most of her closest friends in recent years. Nadar focused the camera so carefully on her face and figure that the chair on which she sat and its shadow on the wall receded into the distance together. Nadar later photographed her a final time, on her deathbed in 1859.

"1510 - 1520","The author of twenty-nine plays, Guillaume-Victor-mile Augier was one of the principal French playwrights of the 1800s. Said to be a bon vivant and something of a lady-killer, Augier here presents a wholly dignified, if distant, appearance for the camera, impeccably dressed and clearly prosperous. He and Nadar had known each other from around the 1840s.At about the same time and from nearly the same angle as this photograph, Nadar made an undatedcaricatureof Augier. Both emphasize, and in the case of the caricature exaggerate, the shape of Augier's most salient feature, his prominent nose. Profile views were rare in Nadar's photographs, probably because they made it impossible to capture the expression of the sitter's eyes and lessened the interaction of subject and photographer. The result here is a more formal portrait than Nadar usually sought.","H:  2 ft. 4 3 4 in. x W:  2 ft. 5 1 8 in. x D:  1 ft. 2 7 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Three Living and the Three Dead","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11097801.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS.

"1510 - 1520","The writer Alexander Dumas was Nadar's boyhood idol. Nadar's father had published Dumas's first novel and play, and a portrait of Dumas hung in young Nadar's room. The son of aFrench revolutionarygeneral and a black mother, Dumas arrived in Paris from the provinces in 1823, poor and barely educated. Working as a clerk, he educated himself in French history and began to write. In 1829 he met with his first success; with credits includingThe Three MusketeersandThe Count of Monte Cristo, published in 1844 and 1845, respectively, his fame and popularity were assured.Nadar was the first photographer to use photography to enhance the sitter's reputation. Given Dumas's popularity, this mounted edition print, signed and dedicated by him, was likely intended for sale.Dumas is represented as a lively, vibrant man. The self-restraint of his crossed hands, resting on a chair that disappears into the shadows, seems like an attempt to contain an undercurrent of boundless energy that threatened to ruin the necessary stillness of the pose and appears to have found an outlet through Dumas's hair. Around the time of this sitting, the prolific Dumas and Nadar were planning to collaborate on a theatrical spectacle, which was ultimately never staged.","2 ft. 4 in. x 2 ft. 7 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 4 7 8 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Christ before Annas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00422601.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS.

"1510 - 1520","Referred to as the  Michelangelo of the menagerie  by critic Thophile Gautier, Antoine-Louis Barye was about sixty when he posed for Nadar. The son of a Parisian jeweler, he studied animal anatomy thoroughly in books, in laboratories, and at the zoo. When a lion died, he and Eugne Delacroix dissected it. Here his stern visage reflects the notably taciturn man who, although he taught drawing, rarely spoke to his students, correcting their work simply by retouching. The overall effect of self-contained if melancholy dignity, of a man who has survived adversity and is beholden to no one, accords well with contemporary descriptions of Barye. His connection with Nadar was probably established through the painters who were friends of both. Barye was seldom photographed, and this image by Nadar, one of the few existing portraits, was later used as the basis for an etching.","3 ft. 1 4 in. x 4 ft. 7 3 8 in. x 1 ft. 6 1 2 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Nativity","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00422701.jpg","Master of the Dresden Prayer Book","MS.

"1510 - 1520","Weary if not haggard, the poet and editor Gustave Mathieu looks out at the viewer with an expression made inscrutable by the cloud of moustache and beard that wholly obscure his mouth. His slight figure is nattily clothed in tartan vest, nubbly tweed trousers, dark jacket, and overcoat. The latter may have been desirable for warmth because at this period many of Nadar's portraits were made in the garden of his rue Saint-Lazare studio.Many of Nadar's sitters were already famous when he photographed them; others became well known later in their lives. Mathieu was neither; his birth and death dates are not known and, aside from this photograph, the remaining records of his life are slight. Mathieu may no longer be a recognized name, but the fact that this is a mounted edition print indicates that Nadar thought there was public interest in his image.","14 1 2 x 10 3 4 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Christ before Caiaphas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00422801.jpg","Master of James IV of Scotland","MS.

He was at least twice Nadar's subject, first in 1851 when Nadar made him the subject of a captionedcaricatureand second when he posed for the camera. Despite his rough-hewn appearance, Luchet had a delicacy of expression in conversation and an honest and generous heart.Luchet's political opinions aligned with those of Nadar, and the two men could be supposed to have much in common. It is thus somewhat surprising that Luchet stares suspiciously, awkwardly constrained in his pose. The overall effect of the portrait is intimate but far from flattering.","9 1 16 x 7 5 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment","Flemish","Spinola Hours","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00163801.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

Contrary to Nadar's usual practice, she is brightly illuminated, making the pattern of her silken dress evident. On the back of her head, she wears a ruffled day cap with wide trailing streamers. Perhaps to better show this complicated headgear, Nadar asked her to turn to one side, creating a profile view that emphasizes her long, straight nose. Her lips part slightly in a suggestion of a smile, indicative of her sweetness of character.Scholars know little of Labiche's life, save that her maiden name was Adle Hubert and that she and playwright Eugne Marin Labiche were married in 1841 or 1842 and had a son named Andr. Sometimes described as an heiress, she came from a respectable and stuffy family that found his profession disreputable and the theatrical milieu immoral. In the introduction to the 1878 collection of his complete plays, which he dedicated to his wife, Labiche recalled that the Hubert family insisted as a condition of his marriage to their daughter that he write no more plays. A year later his wife, seeing his misery, released him from the prohibition.","5 3 16 to 5 1 4 x 16 5 16 x 12 3 4 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Luke","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00422001.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

In the 1850s his performances were wildly popular throughout Europe in concert halls andsalons. This portrait then would have been the equivalent of a publicity photograph. Nadar  photographed Berthelier in character; in a single still image, Nadar  skillfully managed to make the comedianlookfunny.He wears a fanciful, tassel-topped knitted cap while clutching a more sedate hat in front of him. His straw-like hair falls awkwardly around his neck in defiance of gravity and style. Berthelier wears an expression of mischievous glee as he looks off to the side, as if contemplating some act of impropriety taking place just out of the frame.","5 1 8 to 5 3 16 x 16 5 16 x 12 3 4 in.","Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment","Flemish","Saint Matthew","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00422101.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

He was a good friend of Nadar, who photographed Dor many times, even on his deathbed.Dor appears here in the flush of newly earned celebrity, a jaunty young man in checked trousers and a scarf. His sweep of hair cascades across his head as if blown by the wind; his overcoat gapes open to reveal a leg poised to carry him forward, as though he has places to go and can only sit still for a moment. Although the chair in which he sits is clearly visible, he appears to hover unanchored above it.

Nadar much admired the Barbizon painters and their emphasis on nature, declaring that among them Rousseau  has long exhausted praise.  Rousseau's melancholy landscapes displayed a wild and untamed view of nature, seemingly incongruous with the refined figure seen here.Rousseau stands looking at the camera with a directness not evident in most of Nadar's portraits. The photographer conveys Rousseau's strong, intense  character; only the unbuttoned second button on his overcoat suggests any lack of discipline on the part of this sitter.","3 1 4 x 12 x 9 1 4 in.","Tempera colors, gold, and ink on parchment","Flemish","The Last Judgment","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00424001.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

Her beauty mark and pin curl distinguish her from the respectable ladies of her day, although only with historical hindsight could this sweet-faced young woman obviously be a person of loose morals, possibly a prostitute. She looks sad, turning absently away from the camera. If, as historians have suggested, Nadar insisted upon covering up her body in the paisley shawl that appears in other photographs, this working girl was possibly disappointed that her portrait by the renowned photographer was not more obviously revelatory of her charms.","16 x 41 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Jerome Reading","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00425701.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520","Playwright Eugne Scribe poses more conventionally than most of Nadar's sitters from this period. In his mid-sixties, the successful playwright wore elegant and expensive formal daytime clothing. He displays neither playfulness in his costume, as in some Nadar portraits, nor much liveliness of expression. The line of Scribe's mouth is so uncommonly straight as to give little idea of temperament. His left eye is mild and even, but his right eye arrestingly burns out from deep shadow, providing a clue to the anxiety that reportedly caused the playwright to gnaw on his handkerchief when a rehearsal was going badly.Scribe persevered in writing plays despite the failures of his first thirteen works. Critical and popular acclaim, and ultimately great wealth, rewarded his tenacious productivity in writing more than 230 plays and librettos, or texts for musical works. His work is now seldom performed, save for a few operas for which he wrote the librettos.","16 x 41 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","The Virgin and Child","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00425801.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

In 1856 he was decorated with the Legion of Honor, whose insignia he appears to wear on his outer lapel.Nadar's portrait of Prignon bears scant resemblance to the painter's own work, save for his elaborate wardrobe. He is sad-eyed, his expression nearly plaintive, and he has no illusions about the image of gentle fatigue he will present. Although not impatient, he perhaps wished the photographic process were over--despite its brevity when compared to the multiple sittings required for his portrait paintings. By sitting for Nadar, Prignon perhaps tacitly recognized the power of photography to endanger and supplant his own field of endeavor.","8 ft. 9 in. x 3 ft. 5 in. x 1 ft. 3 1 2 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","The Resurrection","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00425901.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

The sitter is thought to be the sculptor Aim Millet, about thirty-seven at this time and poised on the brink of his first great success.Nadar placed Millet in a dynamic pose, his body turned away from the camera to the right and his head twisted back over his shoulder to the left. Both the set of his mouth and his forceful gaze indicate strength of purpose tempered by benevolence; the intensity and energy in this refined figure accord with contemporary descriptions of Millet. As often in Nadar's portraits, the white of the sitter's collar sets off the head from the somber tones of the clothing--in this case, a loose-fitting corduroy jacket. The cuff echoes the collar's white, but the sculptor's talented hands are not visible.","8 ft. 9 in. x 3 ft. 5 in. x 1 ft. 3 1 2 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Michael","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426101.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520","For a photographer so gifted in drawing out the essential traits of his sitters, Nadar seems determined here to create a particularly serious presentation of himself. The result is uncharacteristically stiff and inexpressive. His arms are folded and his hands lost in the folds of his sleeves as if he were bound up in a straight jacket.Although by this time Nadar was an entrepreneur, his clothes present an informal combination of disparate elements in keeping with his self-image as an artist and Bohemian. He wears a silk tie so askew as to appear barely tied at all and a white shirt with a loose-fitting spread collar. His long, loose fashionable coat resembles a painter's smock, perhaps a self-referential nod to his occupation.","H:  24 3 8 x W:  40 1 16 x D:  2 7 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint John the Baptist with the Lamb of God on a Book","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426201.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520","In this self-portrait, Nadar's myopia makes him appear to be intensely staring at the camera, producing the accurate impression of an unremittingly forceful personality. Suspended on a velvet ribbon, his eyeglasses dangle over one of his wrists. To give an impression of spontaneity, he may have intentionally arranged for them to be visible, because in the process of crossing his arms they would more naturally have fallen between his arm and chest. This photograph has the air of a person trying out an attitude in a mirror, and Nadar may have used a mirror to study its composition. The image's close-up intimacy results from the roughly cut edges, with the head and shoulders filling most of the frame.","13 3 4 x 19 5 16 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saints Peter and Paul","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426301.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

Her personal qualities were such that in 1869 she was described as being  of the greatest distinction.  She seems demure if not slightly sad, with a faint smile playing about her lips and her eyes lovingly directed toward her husband, who likely stood nearby as she posed.Nadar very much admired Crmieux, whose political views often coincided with his own. He also admired Madame Crmieux and the harmonious marriage she and her husband shared, which lasted for more than fifty years and ended with their deaths one month apart in 1880.","9 x 16 3 16 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Andrew","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426401.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520"," Art is not a pleasure-trip, it is a battle, a mill that grinds,  remarked the painter Jean-Franois Millet. Born into a peasant family of modest means, Millet celebrated the dignity of manual labor and the humanity, endurance, and piety of the field worker in his paintings. Nadar's portrait of Millet perfectly corresponds with a contemporaneous description of him as  a long, strong, deep-chested man with a full black beard, a grey eye that looks through and through you.  Among his intimates, however, Millet was amiable and occasionally serene.Millet said of photographic portraiture that  this art would never reach perfection till the process could be performed instantaneously and without the knowledge of the sitter. Only in that way, if at all, could a natural and life-like portrait be obtained.  Although he sat for other photographers, Millet may have had the stern formality of Nadar's portrait in mind when he made this statement, perhaps having a milder self-image than this picture gives.","17 3 8 x 14 5 16 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint James as a Pilgrim","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426501.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520","Nadar very much admired the lawyer and politician, Adolphe (Isaac-Mose) Crmieux, whose political views often coincided with his own. Crmieux was sixty when he sat for Nadar in December of 1856 and, as an opponent ofNapoleon IIIlike Nadar, temporarily inactive in politics. Nadar began the sitting, the only one which he ever described in detail, by talking and laughing with Crmieux while placing him in the best light and adjusting the lens. Nadar seems to have placed the camera slightly lower than the subject's eye level, giving him added stature.Crmieux's contemporaries thought the sitter peculiar in both appearance and manner, although his wife disagreed, insisting that Nadar agree with her that her husband was handsome. At least in retrospect the photographer agreed, finding the man beautiful in the tenderness he inspired and merited but more truly--if unconventionally--beautiful because of his  superior intelligence, infinite goodness, perpetual forbearance, love of justice, and above all the inalterable serenity of his pure conscience. Nadar offered this kind of oval print, an edition print, for sale in his studio. Along with his portrait of Madame Crmieux, this image is exceptional in part because more is known about the circumstances of its making than any of Nadar's other portraits.","H: 35 x W: 17 1 2 x D: 13 1 2 x Diam.: 13 1 2 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Sebastian","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426701.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520","When Jules Martial Regnault, called de Prmaray, sat for Nadar in 1857, the two men had known each other for about fifteen years. Before his sitting, de Prmaray wrote to Nadar for advice on the most appropriate clothing for the photograph, suggesting the importance Nadar placed on apparel in his portraits. Whether de Prmaray's velvet smock belonged to him or to Nadar is uncertain, but it seems large for the writer's frail figure and the sleeves appear to have been turned back at the wrists, creating deep satin cuffs.On the back of his photographs, Nadar customarily wrote the professions of his sitters; he designated de Prmaray as a theatrical critic rather than as the playwright he also was. The deep circles under de Prmary's eyes may be symptoms of the severe illness that soon necessitated a three-year course of hydrotherapeutic treatments. By 1859 the critic's precarious health had forced him to give up all kinds of writing, and he died nine years later at age forty-nine.","12 1 8 x 10 1 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Christopher Carrying the Christ Child","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00426801.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

He is more elaborately turned out than any other sitter to appear before Nadar's camera, bedecked with medals--including the cross of San Fernando--that attest to his military prowess. His carriage erect, he looks thoroughly accustomed to holding himself in this formal posture.Because Nadar also photographed Serrano's successor Narvaez in full formal diplomatic regalia, he may have made the two photographs to commemorate the changing of the Spanish ambassadorial guard in September of 1857. Despite his illustrious career, Serrano is perhaps not remembered much today, even in Spain. In happy coincidence with his splendid appearance, however, the Calle Serrano, Madrid's equivalent of Fifth Avenue or Rodeo Drive, is named after him.","12 1 16 x 10 1 16 in.","Temperacolors, gold, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Mary Magdalene with a Book and an Ointment Jar","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00427701.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1510 - 1520","The turbulent life of the writer Henri Mrger originated and epitomized the durable myth of a starving artist struggling to survive in a garret in Paris. His friends were not-yet-famous poets, artists, writers, and musicians, and his short stories about their lives made him famous. These ironic accounts encapsulated and celebrated the bohemian milieu in which both Nadar and Mrger were conspicuous figures.Nadar and Mrger's lives were entwined throughout the 1840s, their deep friendship ending only when Mrger, weakened by hardship and dissipation at the age of forty, died in Nadar's arms. Shortly afterwards Nadar joined two friends in writing a memorial book that included Mrger's letters. It may have been at this time that Nadar rephotographed his 1857 portrait of Mrger to make this tombstone-shaped print. Mrger appears much older than his thirty-five years, and his eyes are oddly wary as he looks toward the camera and one of his closest friends.","12 1 4 x 10 1 4 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Catherine with a Sword and a Book","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00427801.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

As both men were portraitists, each brought a high degree of consciousness about posing subjects to this sitting, which took place while Molin was visiting from Italy.In order to recall portraiture in the grand manner of Anthony Van Dyck, Nadar chose to engulf Molin in a glamorous and voluminous cape of some shiny fabric, embellished by only a complicated, knotted and looped double cord. As Molin's right arm holds the cape across his body and his left is concealed beneath the garment, Nadar must have been the one who puffed up the end of his cravat to provide an additional flourish of white fabric at the neck. Molin's head, the only visible part of his body, is fully lit, concentrating all attention on his face. The circles beneath his eyes counter-balance the tight curves of his eyebrows.","12 1 4 x 10 1 4 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","Flemish","Saint Barbara with a Tower","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00427901.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

Married to a prudish princess whom he apparently disliked, Leopold settled into a life of earthly pleasures, political dissent, lavish generosity, and patronage of the arts. He was nonetheless a talented and ambitious amateur sculptor whose wealth and position made it possible for him to erect public monumental sculptures of his own creation in his native Naples.Alluding to Leopold's job as sculptor or toRenaissanceprincely portraiture, Nadar arranged a great swath of velvet over his sitter's shoulder, effectively shielding his big body. Beneath this sweep of fabric, Leopold appears to wear only a simple shirt with a banded edge, a surprisingly unassuming costume for one of his rank. Together face, drapery, and lighting produce an effect strongly reminiscent of Titian's portraits.","13 13 16 x 20 1 4 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","French","Saint Clara with a Monstrance","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00428001.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

A jack-of-all-trades literary, Vitu revolved through the editorships of several small newspapers and was by turns editor, political or military historian, drama or literary critic, and writer of fiction and financial manuals.By the time Vitu sat for Nadar in 1860, his appearance betrayed his political opinions. His pointed and waxed mustache and goatee are modeled on those of Napoleon III. Nadar, a progressive thinker, lamented the fact that a man as spirited as Vitu had become a sympathizer of the Empire. The intensity of Vitu's gaze reflects his verve.","12 5 8 x 20 5 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","French","Saint Elizabeth","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00428101.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

He used a magnesium lamp, visible in the lower right corner of the image.Six or seven million skeletons were interred in the catacombs; in this photograph, seemingly every one is accounted for. Only sixteen carefully stacked protruding skulls on the wall are clearly distinguishable at left, yet they are all that is needed to indicate what the blackened squares in the distance represent.Around the time that Nadar made this series of a hundred photographs in the catacombs, two of his beloved friends passed away. The photographer may have been exploring his own mortality when he embarked upon this series, but it was also a fashionable pursuit to descend into these macabre depths. In mid-nineteenth century Paris, there were four annual visiting days for the catacombs, at which time they were filled with curious onlookers.","3 11 16 x 4 5 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","French","All Saints","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00428301.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","Leaf: 6 1 2 x 4 1 16 in."
"1520 - 1530","The dreamily romantic and physically frail Alphonse Daudet sat for Nadar in the early 1860s, soon after beginning his career as a poet, playwright, and writer of fiction. In Nadar's portrait, Daudet directed his intense gaze to some farther part of the studio. His pose seems wholly unassuming, his right hand toying with the chair fringe.The apparent informality of the pose was not accidental but the result of Nadar's intention to show the modesty of a very young poet of amiable temperament and humble demeanor. Nadar arranged the light so it would fall from the upper left, crisply delineating the smooth lines of Daudet's forehead and cheek and so illuminating his hair as to turn its color from black to brown.","6 x 4 1 8 in.","9 1 8 x 6 9 16 in.","French","Saint John the Baptist Preaching and Christ with the Apostles","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00428501.jpg","Master of the First Prayer Book of Maximilian","MS.

"1520 - 1530","Auguste Vacquerie, a poet, playwright, paintings collector, and occasional art critic, was admitted to poet Victor Hugo's intimate circle as a very young man. While in exile with Hugo and his family on Jersey, Vacquerie continued to write, grew the beard he wears in Nadar's portrait, and, having learned photography from Hugo's son Charles, made a series of photographs documenting the family and the local landscape. Thus for a short time Vacquerie was a photographer, one of the very few whom Nadar photographed.In order to compete with painted portraits, photographers of the 1850s and 1860s frequently employed artists to embellish their images. Nadar was not an exception in this practice, although few painted photographs from his studio have survived. In this example, variously dense layers of reddish-black ink cover almost the entire surface of the print, with the overall effect of coarsening the image. Although the ink has been skillfully applied, particularly in the hair and beard, the subtlety of expression around Vacquerie's eyes has been lost and the shape of his mouth distorted. The retoucher radically changed the shape of Vacquerie's left sleeve by painting out a billowing wrinkle in order to simplify the silhouette. With his photographic sensibilities, Vacquerie may have rejected the painted proof, causing it to remain in Nadar's studio.","16 5 16 x 12 3 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold paint, and ink on parchment","Flemish","Decorated Text Page","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11005701.jpg","Master of the Getty Epistles","MS.

"1480","Amandine-Aurore-Lucile Dudevant, ne Dupin, took the pseudonym George Sand in 1832. She was a successfulRomanticnovelist and a close friend of Nadar, and during the 1860s he photographed her frequently. Her writing was celebrated for its frequent depiction of working-class or peasant heroes. She was also a woman as renowned for her romantic liaisons as her writing; here she allowed Nadar to photograph her, devoid of coquettish charms but nevertheless a commanding presence.This portrait is a riot of textural surfaces. The sumptuous satin of Sand's gown and silken texture of her hair have a rich tactile presence. Her shimmering skirt melts into the velvet-draped support on which she leans, creating a visual triangle with the careful center part of her wavy hair. The portrait details the exquisite laces, beads, and buttons of her gown, but her face, the apex of the triangle, is out of focus. Sand was apparently unable to remain perfectly still throughout the exposure, and the slight blurring of her facial features erases the unforgiving details that the years had drawn upon her.","12 1 16 x 9 in.","Tempera colors, gold paint, and ink on parchment","Flemish","Decorated Text Page","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11005801.jpg","Master of the Getty Epistles","MS.

"1480 - 1483","Introduced in the 1860s, cabinet cards were studio-produced photographs mounted on cardstock. Inexpensive multiples offered for public sale, they often featured portraits of celebrities of the day--writers, musicians, actors--and were widely collected. Nadar's photograph ofSarahBernhardt (French, 1844-1923) as Phdre is from a collector's album of cabinet card portraits of Bernhardt by various photographers.A famous actress in the late 1800s, the  Divine Sarah  was a brilliant self-promoter at a time when the basis of celebrity was shifting from the political figure to the theatrical performer. Bernhardt pioneered the use of new technologies to disseminate her image: she was one of the most photographed women in the world, and the first major stage actress to star in films. She made several recordings of famous theatrical dialogues including a reading from Racine's Phdre at Thomas Edison's home.A recognizable figure, Bernhardt--often depicted in theatrical costume--endorsed commercial products. Contemporary with this cabinet card, her image appeared on cigarette cards, an early form of product promotion. Advertisements as well as collectable ephemera, cigarette cards like cabinet cards, reinforced Bernhardt's image in popular culture.","8 7 16 x 11 1 2 in.","Tempera colors, gold paint, and ink on parchment","Flemish","Text Page","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11005901.jpg","Master of the Getty Froissart","MS.

"1480 - 1483","The extraordinary actressSarahBernhardt was about twenty when she posed for Nadar and had barely begun her long and phenomenally successful career. Nadar's photograph was probably the first of innumerable images by painters, photographers, sculptors, and graphic artists. At a time when Nadar was preoccupied with ballooning and willing to leave most of the portrait work to studio assistants, Bernhardt drew him back into the studio to make touching images of her delicate face. Here he wrapped her with a great sweep of velvet that bared one shoulder but showed no more of her slender body, centering all attention on her head, which is seen nearly in profile.The young woman with the supple shoulders and the golden voice became an incomparable and indomitable actress, famous first in France and then throughout the world for playing heroines-and heroes-in a wide variety of plays. Bernhardt's celebrity and the enormous attention she attracted everywhere she went anticipated the phenomenon of late twentieth-century media stars.","38 1 4 x 11 5 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchmentbound between pasteboard covered with greenmorocco","Flemish","Chronicles (Book Three)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00167601.jpg","Master of the Getty Froissart","MS.

"1480","When the poet, playwright, and novelist Victor Hugo died in 1885, Nadar went to his deathbed to make a final image as a memorial of the great man. Nadar's sketch of the death chamber showed that black drapery was tied across a window behind the bed and then to one of the bedposts in order to visually isolate Hugo's recumbent figure against a somber background. For the photograph, a mirror reflected light back from the window to provide detail in the shadow area.During the 1800s, Hugo was thought to be France's greatest writer. He began to write while still a schoolboy, and his poetry was first published at twenty. His wildly popular novels soon followed. Hugo's troubled personal life, however, stood in sharp contrast to his successful career. His wife was conspicuously in love with another man, his favorite daughter drowned, and another went mad. A talented amateur artist, he was interested in photography and once contemplated illustrating a book of his poems with photographic negatives. By the time of his death, Hugo was revered: his body lay in state under the Arc de Triomphe, and he was buried in the Panthon. Paul Nadar made this print in the 1920s from his father's negative of 1885.","17 1 2 x 12 1 2 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Flemish","The King of Cyprus Killed by his Brothers' Persecutors","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00480201.jpg","Master of the Getty Froissart","MS.

Nattier, one of the leading portraitists of his day, specialized in these flattering allegorical portraits.

The vignette effect of the print's darkened edges was a technical sacrifice that Ngre accepted in order to shorten his exposure time.

"1480 - 1483","The Panathenaia, a state religious festival, honoredAthena, the patron goddess of Athens. Held in its expanded form every four years, the festival included athletic, musical, and other competitions. Amphorae filled with oil pressed from olives from the sacred trees of Athena were given as prizes in the Panathenaic Games. These amphorae had a special form with narrow neck and foot and a standard fashion of decoration. One side showed Athena, the goddess of war, armed and striding forth between columns, and included the inscription  from the games at Athens.  The other side showed the event for which the vase was a prize. Leading vase-painters, commissioned by the state, decorated these vessels, which continued to be decorated in theblack-figure techniquelong after it had gone out of fashion for other vases, probably due to religious conservatism. The same conservatism applied to the depiction of Athena.On this example, the figure of Athena is portrayed in anArchaisticor old-fashioned style. TheNikefigures atop akanthos columns flanking Athena are a detail that allows scholars to date this vase precisely to 363 2 B.C. The back of the vase depicts Nike, the goddess of victory, crowning the winner of a boxing match between young men, while an older, bearded judge looks on. The leather thongs held by the youths identify them as boxers; they were wrapped around the hands and served as the ancient equivalent of boxing gloves. In 370 B.C. the victor in youth boxing won forty amphorae of oil; the second place winner took home eight.","28 9 16 x 11 3 4 x 13 7 8 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Bohemian","The Soldiers of Brabant Entering Ravenstein","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00484901.jpg","Master of the Getty Froissart","MS.

"1480 - 1483","A sacramentary, the most important type of liturgical book used in the early medieval Church, contains the prayers recited by the priest at Mass. The book lay open on the church altar--the most sacred site within the building--where the priest celebrated the Mass while worshipers looked on. This Ottonian manuscript includes a full-page Crucifixion and beautiful illuminated initials executed in gold and silver ink. The quality of the decoration of this manuscript, of which only a fragment survives, suggests that it may have been made for the occasion of the consecration in 1017 of Hugh, the young son of Robert the Pious king of France, as Robert's co-ruler and successor. Since it includes prayers addressed to saints venerated at Beauvais, the book may have been presented by King Robert to the bishop of Beauvais, who was present at the consecration event. The writing and illumination have been attributed to Nivardus of Milan, who worked at the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Benot-sur-Loire, at Fleury, France. In addition to the gold and silver letters, the manuscript is decorated with elaborate interlace ornament and sprays of leaves that recall classical and ninth-century Carolingian models.","H:  31 1 2 x L:  88 1 8 x D:  27 1 8 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Bohemian","The Count de Blois Sending an Army to Support the King of France","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00485201.jpg","Master of the Getty Froissart","MS. 97"

While the Virgin Mary and Saint John stand at the foot of the cross and turn towards Jesus with the traditional gestures of mourning, Jesus' powerful body and open eyes suggest his ultimate victory over death. The use of purple-painted parchment, long associated with art works of imperial patronage, enhances the image's majesty, while the exuberant interlace boxes that link the cross ends with the image's frame add tension and vibrancy to the design.","22 1 16 x 13 3 8 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Flemish","The Scottish Defeating the English and Capturing Henry and Raoul Percy","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00485601.jpg","Master of the Getty Froissart","MS. 97, LEAF 1"

In the foreground, figures strolling along the left bank of the Seine had a clear view across the river of the grand, ceremonial space linking the Champs Elyses, shown all the way on the left by a triumphal arch, with the Tuileries gardens on the far right. In the center, two imposing buildings housed government offices. In front of these buildings is a monumental bronze equestrian statue of Louis XV that was melted down for a cannon in 1792. As one of the great new public spaces in Paris in the 1700s, the Place de la Concorde was portrayed by many painters and engravers.","80 7 8 x 56 1 4 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, and gold paint on parchment","French","Three Leaves from an Antiphonal","www.getty.edu art collections images l 26499801.jpg","Master of the Golden Bull","MS. 97, LEAF 3V"
"1405","Four rigid bronze forms create a skeletal tent. Two interlocking diagonal beams serve as the tent's opening. These beams, as well as a third vertical form, have pointed tops suggestive of spears. Positioned on top of these beams, a single horizontal beam demarcates the tent's top edge. This snake-like form also insinuates violence: its gaping mouth, sharp fangs, and bulging eyes suggest that within the tent lies danger.Isamu Noguchi originally created this form as a stage set for choreographer and dancer Martha Graham's 1950 productionJudith. This sculpture is one of three bronze casts made from the balsawood original that appeared on stage. Graham'sJudithwas based on the biblical story of Judith and Holofernes. The widow Judith seduced and then decapitated the general Holofernes who was laying siege to her hometown. Noguchi's sculpture alludes to the tent in which Judith beheads Holofernes. The tent's phallic spears convey Holofernes' desire for Judith; the serpent form, the peril awaiting the doomed general.Noguchi created stage sets throughout his career. When working on a scenic design, he would often arrange the elements on a miniature stage. This allowed him to play with the formal and spatial relationships between the objects. Noguchi desired his three-dimensional forms to animate space and positively alter the viewer's experience of the environment.","21 1 8 x 29 9 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, and gold paint on parchment","French","Initial H: Saint Stephen","www.getty.edu art collections images l 26634201.jpg","Master of the Golden Bull","MS. 60, RECTO"

Despite their respective marriages and a considerable difference in age, Dorothy Norman and Stieglitz had an intimate relationship. As a result of Stieglitz's encouragement, Norman began experimenting with photography in the early 1930s.

Norman had been experimenting with photography under Stieglitz's instruction for about six years when she made this image. Often regarded as the father of American photography, Stieglitz was an influential figure in Norman's life. After meeting at his New York gallery, they began an intimate relationship that lasted almost two decades. In the 1930s, Norman published a journal entitledTwice A Year,which contained reproductions of Stieglitz's work as well as essays on his philosophy of art and its interpretation.","11 5 8 x 8 1 2 in.","Temperacolors andgold leafonparchment","French and Flemish","Initial D: The Fool with Two Demons","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13615401.jpg","Master of the Ingeborg Psalter","MS. 66, FOL. 105V"

General Reynolds was killed during the battle and had already been removed from the field.

The boy stands patiently carrying his master's belongings--a walking stick and a basket covered with a cloth--and holds out a jug for him to urinate into. Many Greek vases were designed for use atsymposia, or drinking parties. Vase-painters frequently depicted the physical effects of indulgence, from over-stretched bladders to upset stomachs. Since symposia were aristocratic events, faithful servants often appear, shepherding the revelers through their difficulties.The decoration on this vessel is particularly appropriate. This special form ofoinochoe, called a chous, was used during the Anthesteria, a three-day religious festival in honor ofDionysos, the god of wine. A drinking contest was held on the second day of the festival, and choes were used to hold a standard amount of wine for the contest.","7 1 4 x 2 11 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","Alexander Fights with a Lion and Kills Clitus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00575501.jpg","Master of the Jardin de vertueuse consolation","MS.

They combine the two traditional Athenian vase-decoration techniques: the older technique of black-figure, and red-figure, the technique that would gain popularity and continue to be used through the fourth century B.C. On a black-figure vase, silhouettes in black gloss are contrasted against the red-orange clay of the vessel. On a red-figure vase, the forms come from the red-orange color of the clay, and the space around them is filled in with black gloss. Like most bilingual cups, this is an eye-cup, with large eyes painted on the red-figured exterior and a single black figure on the tondo of the interior.

One could always find people sketching, and everyone eagerly consulted M. Oudry; in these picturesque pastimes he excelled like an instructor in his class.Thus wrote Oudry's biographer in the 1800s. Many of Oudry's nearly fifty large-scale park scenes from between 1744 and 1747 depict these gardens of Arcueil, at the Prince de Guise's chateau near Paris, which were destroyed not long after. Oudry's landscape drawings, of which approximately one thousand still exist, combine a love of nature; a free, rapid drawing style; and a sensitivity to the effects of light.Here Oudry used white chalk sparingly for subtlehighlightson the tan paper. He created depth with a strong receding diagonal line and black chalk markings ranging from the darkforegroundto the lighter areas of the sky.

"1450s","Despite my considerable experience in the field of photography, I was for a long time unsure whether I would ever succeed in producing a good carbro print. Many of these pictures were produced with considerable technical difficulties unknown to today's users of more recent and much simpler color materials. Each shot cost $150, and many hours of work were necessary to produce it. Three different shots with varying exposures had to be made with three different color filters. After this, three separate color images each one thousandth of an inch thick had to be transferred onto paper one by one and precisely superimposed one on top of the other.--Paul OuterbridgePaul Outerbridge described the practical and technical concerns with making this image, but what of the aesthetic impulse  The photograph has been cropped from the full negative, which included the model's face and slightly more of both arms, to this disturbing image of a woman piercing her own breast and abdomen with the sharp tips of meat packer's gloves. Although Outerbridge described the arduous carbro process, this photograph contains very subdued color. The realistic representation of flesh tone, however, and the lack of pubic hair--it was airbrushed out--make the nude subject even more shocking.","15 1 2 x 9 3 4 in.","10 3 8 x 7 1 4 in.","Flemish","The Visitation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00388901.jpg","Master of the Llangattock Hours","MS.

Around 1400 B.C., however, artists, probably inspired by wall painting, developed a less common pictorial style of pottery decoration. Bulls were frequent subjects on this pictorial pottery, and the man grasping the bull by the horn on this jar may be a bull jumper. Bull jumping, a ritual performance that originated in the Minoan culture on Crete, involved literally grabbing the horns of a bull and somersaulting over its back. If this man was a bull jumper, the sphinx and the pomegranates may indicate an unsuccessful leap resulting in his death, since they had funerary connotations in later Greek art.Most Mycenaean pictorial pottery has been found in the eastern Mediterranean, especially onCyprus. In the 1300s and 1200s B.C., Mycenaean Greeks exerted a strong influence over Cyprus.

The term phlyax is used for both farces parodying the heroes and themes of mythology or the comic elements of everyday life and for the actors who performed them. These plays were popular in the 300s and 200s B.C. in the Greek colonies in Italy. The term phlyax probably derives from the Greek verb  to swell  and finds its meaning in the actor's costume of a mask, tights, a padded tunic, and a large artificial phallus.

It was part of a large suite of furniture for Vittorio Emanuele, Duke of Savoy and first king of a united Italy, and his bride for the nuptial apartment in the Palazzo Racconigi outside of Turin. Its form and decoration combine elements from a variety of sources. The palmettes and Ionic capitals come from ancient Greek art, while lotus petals and lion's-paw feet are inspired by Egyptian motifs. The furniture, designed by Filippo Pelagio Palagi, was executed by Gabriele Capello, nicknamed Il Moncalvo, and other craftsmen.The sophisticated inlaid decoration was made using an innovative technique that allowed the craftsmen to quickly create a smooth, uniform surface. The striking upholstery, with its bold patterns and vivid color, is a copy of the original fabric, probably designed by Filippo Pelagio Palagi and hand-woven in Lyon.","6 3 16 x 5 5 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, gold paint, and ink onparchment","Flemish","The Portuguese Embassy","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00480801.jpg","Master of the Soane Josephus","MS.

The subject is adapted from a passage in the Faerie Queene, a poem first published in 1590 by the English writer Edmund Spenser. In the poem, however, Phaedria refused, much against Sir Guyon's wishes, to take the palmer as well, and he was left behind on the bank.

From the dappled clouds to the melting sunlight that modulates all that it envelops, the range of technique is extraordinary.

When war threatened, Ulysses and other Greek chieftains were sent to fetch him, knowing they had to trick him into revealing himself. Cunningly, they deposited a heap of gifts before the women: jewelry, clothes, and other finery, but also a sword and shield.

By that time, printed reproductions of actual classical wall decoration and furniture made on the spot began to appear, providing a fertile source of inspiration for both painters and craftsmen. In the past, artists had created objects and designs based on strange blends of ancientmotifsand newly invented ones. Now, with direct copies of actual objects available to a wider market, a new demand arose for more authentic classically inspired interiors.","13 11 16 x 10 3 16 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Flemish","John of Gaunt Advancing against Betanzos","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00482501.jpg","Unknown","MS.

He used self-discipline to transform his initial passionate concepts from the freedom and rhythms of sheets like this to the famed glacial grace of his panel paintings. An instinctive and prolific draftsman, he often covered both sides of sheets with varied figures and themes.Scholars generally connect the drawings on the recto--Saint John the Baptist, Saint Jerome, a crucifix seen from the side, and several heads--with Parmigianino's famous altarpiece, theVision of Saint Jeromein the National Gallery of Art in London. Parmigianino may also have drawn these figures as a compositional study for a similar, earlier altarpiece that was either lost or never made.

Coupled with his quick, fertile imagination, Parmigianino's mastery of pen, ink, wash, and heightening gives this rendering a refreshing spontaneity. The artist crafted the dynamic composition from lively, fluid, yet never superfluous lines and modulated the wash with the touch of a brush for lighter or darker tones. He used white heightening, which can easily overpower a drawing, in a precise, economical, and balanced manner.Parmigianino made this drawing in preparation for an altarpiece,The Vision of Saint Jerome, of about 1526, now in London's National Gallery, but the painted figure ended up less powerful and older than this vigorous creature. His study of  monumental ancient sculpture and Michelangelo's art led to this figure's expansiveness and muscularity.A later collector may have cut the sheet at the top, eliminating parts of the head and arms.","2 ft. 8 7 8 in. x 4 ft. 3 in. x 1 ft. 8 1 2 in.","18 7 8 x 13 3 4 in.","Dutch","The Departure of John of Gaunt from Santiago de Compostela","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00482901.jpg","Unknown","MS.

In 1781Louis XVIbought one of these garnitures for his library at the palace ofVersailles.

The Getty Museum owns three of the original five vases, while the two smallest now belong to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland.These vases are among the largest pieces of jeweled porcelain made at Svres. Jeweling was an elaborate form of decoration in which the ground color was covered with stamped gold foils. Small drops of colored enamel were then applied to the foils, imitating jewels, pearls, and moss agates.

Scenes of a woman at her toilette are found in Athenian vase-painting from the early 500s B.C. on, but the women are usually clothed. The portrayal of this woman as nude may indicate that she is a hetaira, or prostitute. The use of added white paint for the woman's flesh--an unusual choice in red-figure pottery of the mid-400s B.C.--further emphasizes her nudity. This vase did not fire properly in the kiln. Much of its surface is a red-brown, rather than the standard deep black of Athenian pottery.

"410","A nude youth holding a crop rides his horse on the front of this Chalkidianblack-figureneck-amphora. The back of the vase depicts a man and a woman who appear to be conversing. Chalkidian pottery was made by a workshop of immigrant Greek vase-painters who settled in Italy. Scholars call the style Chalkidian because some vases bear inscriptions written in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece. Through two generations of production in Italy, Chalkidian pottery remained thoroughly Greek in conception. For example, the depiction of a rider on this vase derived from the long-standing Greek use of the horse as a symbol of status and wealth. A painter's miscalculation on this vase sheds light on his creative process. On the front of the vase, the Phineus Painter first drew a set of lines marking out the panel for decoration. Then, he proceeded to paint the horse but found that the panel was too small and the horse's tail hung out over the edge. The last stage of vase decoration was to cover thebackgroundareas with black glaze. When the Phineus Painter reached this point, he had to accommodate the tail by creating a slanting area behind the horse rather than following his vertical guidelines.","9 15 16 x 13 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","German porcelain","Christ Cleansing the Temple","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00057501.jpg","Meidias Painter","86.AE.259"

The cup itself has a distinctive form with a deep bowl, a large foot with a tall, concave profile, and a thick ring joining the foot and the bowl. Scholars refer to cups with this combination of form and decoration as Chalkidian cups. The strikingly angular form of the foot has led some scholars to believe that the shape of the cup may have been derived from metal prototypes. Eyes decorate the exterior of all Chalkidian cups. In Greek thought, large, staring eyes had an apotropaic power, that is, they had the ability to ward off evil and danger. The painted eyes on this cup may have protected the drinker, or the frontal face may have represented an abbreviated mask connected withDionysos, the god of wine.Scholars do not know precisely where Chalkidian pottery was made. Inscriptions on some vases have letters in the alphabet of the city of Chalkis in Greece, but no vases have been found there, or anywhere outside Italy and the western Mediterranean. The vases were probably made in a Chalkidian colony in southern Italy or in an immigrant workshop inEtruria.","540 x 360 x 136 in.","Terracotta","German","Red-Figure Lekythos","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01546301.jpg","Meidias Painter","H:  9 7 8 in."

Piranesi took a creative approach when he made architectural fantasies like this one, usingantiqueruins as his point of departure. On this process he wrote:These speaking ruins have filled my spirit with images that accurate drawings, even such as those of the immortal Palladio, could never have succeeded in conveying, though I always kept them before my eyes.Piranesi first drew the main outlines of the architecture in chalk, then added brown and redwashfor shading and details.

Reaching out and touching one another, the figures connect and draw the viewer's eye upwards. Unlike an academic study of the static male figure, however, this is a study of movement. The drawing illustrates how Piranesi worked out ideas about form and posture. In some ways, the lively figures are unrealistic. For example, Piranesi put little effort into describing their hands and feet, which seem to end abruptly or break off altogether. The jagged parallel shading in the body adds energy but indicates his lack of concern for muscular detail. The drawing may have formed part of a stock selection in Piranesi's workshop, from which he could later borrow images. He was known to enliven many of his compositions with human figures, although these particular figures have not been specifically identified with that purpose.","24 x 16 11 16 in.","Terracotta","German","Mixing Vessel with Adonis, Aphrodite, and Persephone","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01499801.jpg","Pedro de Mena y Medrano","2000.20"

The gray sky and the trees losing their leaves indicate autumn.Painting in the open air alongside Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pissarro followed a new practice of breaking up surfaces with loosely placed brushstrokes. This revolutionary technique, the cornerstone of Impressionism, helps to reveal how light and movement affect the perception of objects. Pissarro made the canvas a field of textures and movement; the character of the brushstroke varies according to the texture and form of the object it describes. For example, the haystack is painted with straw-shaped brushstrokes, the leaves are suggested by jagged daubs of paint, and the stucco walls are depicted with broad, smooth strokes.","12 1 4 x 16 13 16 in.","Pastel on paper, laid on canvas","French","Portrait of William Burton Conyngham","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13768601.jpg","Mennecy Porcelain Manufactory","86.DE.473"

A single figure and, in the distance, a figure and carriage, move along the desolate road curving through the scene.Camille Pissarro's landscape shows the road to the town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye from Louveciennes, a village west of Paris. Many of Pissarro's landscapes of the early 1870s show the roads into and out of Louveciennes. Pissarro himself lived intermittently in Louveciennes and was part of a close-knit community of landscape painters who lived or traveled there including Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.During the early 1870s, Pissarro began experimenting with the emerging Impressionist painting style by returning to watercolor, a medium he had used as a student during the 1850s. Using black chalk, Pissarro first indicated the main features of the composition. He then fleshed out the scene by covering almost the entire sheet with watercolor. Pissarro experimented with some of the spontaneous effects of watercolor, allowing it to pool and tide in some areas and applying it more evenly in others to create a diffuse light. He used broad, wet strokes to define the sky and smaller strokes, with more pigment on the brush, to articulate the foliage and figures.Also in the Getty's collection, the paintingHouses at Bougival (Autumn)was made by Pissarro about one year before this drawing. Although they depict similar subjects, the two works explore different effects. Here, the artist focuses on the fleeting atmospheric effects of light and air; in the painting, Pissarro places more emphasis on the geometric properties of the houses in the landscape.","2 3 8 x 2 13 16 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, polychrome enamel decoration","German","Lidded Bowl","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13689001.jpg","Mennecy Porcelain Manufactory","84.GB.6"

"1764","According to Greek legend, Achilles fell in love with theTrojanprincess Polyxena, the daughter of the king of Troy. He was offered her hand in marriage if he agreed to end the war between the Greeks and the Trojans. At Polyxena's request, Achilles came to make a sacrifice toApollo, but he was ambushed byParis, Polyxena's brother, as he knelt at the altar. Paris shot a fatal arrow into Achilles' heel, his one vulnerable spot. Before he died, Achilles vengefully proclaimed that the treacherous Polyxena be sacrificed at his tomb.Here Giovanni Battista Pittoni depicted the ghost of Achilles demanding that his bride be killed. Polyxena, wearing a white wedding gown, extends her arm toward the priest brandishing a knife and with great dignity steps forward toward the tomb. Around her, a throng of Greeks and Trojans watch with mixed emotions. Although a violent subject, Pittoni's elegant, richly garbed figures and elaborateantiquearchitecture make an appealing picture of mythological martyrdom.","8 1 16 x 6 11 16 in.","Soft-paste porcelain","American","Figure of a Street Vendor","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00676901.jpg","Adolf von Menzel","72.DB.57"

On the more finished left side of the drawing, the horse and scrolling leafy branches burst with vitality, though seen in sculptural rather than fleshy terms. The supple line work and the bold application ofwashindicating shadows carry through the impression of stone rather than living tissue. On the right, in contrast, Plepp merely outlined the symmetrical elements and summarily filled them in.

The Capitol, whose original building was begun in 1791 and took thirty-four years to construct, stands at the intersection of Pennsylvania, Constitution, and Independence Avenues. When Plumbe photographed it in the 1840s, before extensive expansions had begun, it was a relatively simple building but one that had already been altered by at least four architects.

"1983","Bernardino Poccetti made a number of individual figure drawings in chalk as studies for painted compositions. This figure was probably intended as a study for a wallfresco. Given the position of the legs and the angle of the man's face and arm, the final work in which he appeared was probably meant to be seen from below.Poccetti used the white of the paper to create the reflection of light off the man's costume and skin. The delicate contour and line-his chalk barely touched the paper-give the figure an appearance of refinement. Broad modeling, appearing in some areas as quick scribbles across the sheet, flattens the picture and creates a linear pattern across the sheet. Rather than setting the figure of the man off, Poccetti connected it to the background with shading almost entirely surrounding it.","5 1 4 x 7 15 16 in.","Alabaster","France","The Vexed Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30504901.jpg","Ray K.

The arched ceiling draws the viewer's eye into the setting, while contrasting patches of dark shadow and light keep it moving.

He juxtaposed broadly washed areas of deep shadow with brilliantlyilluminatedpassages articulated by the white paper. His interesting choice of an oblique view of the arch, highlighting the narrow columns, and his omission of several architectural features allowed Poelenburgh to treat it as blocks of light and shadow rather than as a specific structure. Clusters of vegetation growing through cracks in the stonework, formed with simple, looped strokes, appear as the only distraction.","3 1 2 x 7 3 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","City Whispers, Philadelphia","www.getty.edu art collections images l 33633301.jpg","Constantin Meunier","2004.46.2"

The landscape captures the atmospheric qualities of the Italian countryside and deliberately calls to mind an idyllic mythological land filled with languidnymphs.Van Poelenburgh was best known for cabinet-size paintings, small easel paintings intended to be viewed at close range.

He drew Saint Francis over a partially obliterated standing man with a staff in his left hand, posed frontally with his head tilted to the left.Pontormo also conserved paper on theverso, drawing a powerful image of the dead Christ with his head thrown dramatically backward, over a female figure in profile. With a flurry of pencil strokes, he suggested an emaciated body with slender limbs and taut flesh.

"1860 - 1862","Sharp, angular, energetic lines, seen most clearly on the verso figure, frequently characterized Pontormo's drawing style. While these are merely studies, exploring ideas for parts of a painting, they clearly suggest the emotional intensity of his art and the sharp contrast with the preceding ideal of classical High Renaissance harmony.Pontormo made these drawings as preliminary figure studies for an altarpiece commissioned for a church in Florence in 1518, a work that some scholars consider the first clear manifestation of Mannerism in Italian painting. The full-length figure on the recto served as a source for the putto at the painting's top right.The kneeling figure on the verso was a study for the young John the Baptist, who appears in the same general pose at the painting's center and also looks upward. In working out the exact pose for this figure, Pontormo first drew the right leg sharply bent in red chalk, then sketched it in fully extended. In the final painting, he settled on an angle between the two.","6 ft. 3 1 2 in. x 2 ft. 1 1 2 in. x 1 ft. 11 1 2 in.","Oil on panel","French","The Doctor's Visit","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00092001.jpg","Nicholas Mignard","84.XP.926.7"

He probably made the studies in preparation for afrescohe painted at aMedicivilla outside Florence from 1520 to 1521. After conceiving of the composition of the fresco as a whole, he tried out individual figures. He may have used and reused aspects of the pose of this body for several of the fresco's figures.Biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote that Pontormo almost obsessively revised his ideas for this fresco; his many known drawings for the project attest to the search for perfection. In the foot and calf of this figure in particular, Pontormo approached the paper repeatedly, imparting almost nervous energy as he refined the lines. On the verso, the smooth outlines of the reclining figure skillfully match the relaxation and refinement of the pose itself. Pontormo ultimately transformed this figure's pose into that of a female attendant in the fresco.","5 9 16 x 7 7 8 in.","Black chalk with traces of white chalk","French","Midas, King of Phrygia","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13546901.jpg","John Everett Millais","2004.73.3"
"1945","Using soft, broad strokes of black chalk, Pontormo built up the figure of a young man lying on his right side, propping himself up on his elbow. Ambiguous facial features indicate that Pontormo was more interested in the figure's posture than in a true likeness of an individual. Pontormo made this drawing as a preparatory study for a scene of the martyrdom of Saint Lawrencefor theCertosa del Galluzzo, a monastery outside Florence. However, it was Pontormo's pupil Bronzino who executed the finished fresco.Saint Lawrence is usually depicted as a young man. According to legend, Lawrence was a third-century Roman deacon who was responsible for distributing goods to the poor. When a greedy high-ranking official demanded that Lawrence give him the church's treasure, Lawrence presented a group of poor people, saying that they were the church's treasure. For this defiant act, he was arrested and tortured on a burning gridiron.  In the finished work, Bronzino made only small changes to Pontormo's composition.  Bronzino's figure lies on a gridiron and turns his head to the left, as he is crowned by a cherub. He holds a palm leaf in his left hand, an emblem of martyrdom. Pontormo's drawing probably provided Bronzino with a model for human musculature and proportions that artists strived to achieve in the 1500s.","50 3 4 x 66 15 16 in.","Oil on canvas","French","The Ransom","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00068901.jpg","Lee Miller","95.PA.67"
"1841","Standing before a fortress wall, this well-dressed foot soldier holds a combination spear and battle-ax called a halberd. His direct stare and swaggering pose are strikingly poignant, given the smooth unlined face and slim body that betray him as no more than a teenager. As a portraitist, Jacopo Pontormo was renowned for his subtle, complex psychological studies; here he conveyed the naive arrogance and vulnerability of youth. Court painter to Duke Cosimo de' Medici, Pontormo pioneered the Mannerist style in Florence, initiating a new, sophisticated type of portraiture in which elegance and aristocratic reserve play key roles. The sitter's identity has been much discussed. The Florentine painter Giorgio Vasari noted that during the siege of Florence in about 1528 Pontormo painted a  most beautiful work,  a portrait of young nobleman Francesco Guardi as a soldier. Francesco's birthdate of 1514 would make him about the age of Pontormo's teenage sitter. Based on a Florentine inventory, Cosimo de' Medici himself has also been suggested as the painting's subject.","32 x 25 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Portrait of Space","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05184801.jpg","Lee Miller","96.GF.12"

The pathos shown on the face of Saint Peter Martyr and the brute strength indicated by the muscular right arm and fist of the assassin indicate the artist's skill in capturing this violent act.

"1860 - 1862","I had heard Glen Canyon described, by those who planned to reserve that part of the river for hydroelectric power development, as an unspectacular, gently flowing stretch of the river unruffled by significant rapids, that in fact the Bureau of Reclamation had begun to dam. From the very first day, I was overwhelmed by the scenery--both in prospect and in description grossly underrated. The monumental structure of the towering walls in variety and color defied comprehension.--Eliot PorterEliot Porter made his first rafting trip down the Colorado River through Glen Canyon in 1960. He became captivated by the region's beauty, and over the next decade, returned to it ten times to photograph its weathered trees, colorful rock formations, and hidden slit canyons. This image of a sheer sandstone wall in vivid shades of salmon and purple demonstrates Porter's keen observation of the region's unique beauty.In the early 1960s, the Sierra Club was in the middle of a campaign to stop construction of a hydroelectric plant on the Colorado River at Glen Canyon. Its director thought a book of Porter's photographs might be persuasive. Porter had already collaborated with the environmental organization on a publication that earned critical praise. In 1963, the Sierra Club and Porter published the bookThe Place No One Knew: Glen Canyon on the Colorado.Copies were sent to President John F. Kennedy and members of Congress. That same year, construction of the Glen Canyon Dam was completed, creating Lake Powell and flooding hundreds of miles of the river and its tributary canyons. Porter's Glen Canyon photographs became especially meaningful in the aftermath of the dam's construction, as a record of a lost national treasure. Glen Canyon lacked national park status and protection because it was  the place no one knew.  Although Porter's efforts did not stop construction of the dam, they did spur federal review of reclamation projects on western rivers and passage of the Wilderness Act.","11 5 16 x 7 3 8 in.","Black and white chalk with occasional touches of colored pastel","Italian","Le chat (The Cat at the Window)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10869801.jpg","Jean-Franois Millet","83.GF.220"

"1891","The beauty of the Icelandic landscape is not limited to volcanic phenomena, the mountains of igneous rock, the torrential rivers and thunderous falls, or the ice-filled glacial lakes; its vegetation is also a major attraction. The trees are dwarfed and stunted. Tundra covers much of the interior; arctic and alpine wildflowers bloom in seemingly unlimited abundance in summer. But the most striking contribution to Iceland's plant life is its mosses.--Eliot PorterA consistent thread in Eliot Porter's photography is his scientific attention to detail; his ability to observe what often goes unnoticed. Iceland's luxurious mosses, which blanket the region instead of forests, first drew Porter to visit the island in 1972. This photograph displays their startling range of colors and textures. Rocks rounded and smoothed by river water are draped with splotches of rust, yellow, gold, and green.In 1972, the Sierra Club published Iceland, a portfolio of twelve dye transfer prints in an edition of 110. Porter also wanted to publish a book on the subject, but he could not find a publisher.  Undaunted, Porter persisted and seventeen years later, it was published. The book contains an essay by Porter's son Jonathan, who often traveled with him. In the foreword, Jonathan wrote:  Iceland possesses a primordial quality, as if one were a time traveler viewing an earlier formative age of the earth.  Porter's close-up views, like this one, convey that uniqueness.","9 1 16 x 5 5 16 in.","Oil on canvas","American","Man with a Hoe","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00087901.jpg","Jean-Franois Millet","72.PA.32"

Many of the plants, fish, birds, and other animals woven in this hanging can be traced to life studies made by Eckhout and Post in South America.

"1635 - 1640","Silhouetted against rolling, stormy, clouds, a gray, spotted horse stands, turning its head slightly to suggest its alertness to its surroundings. Paulus Potter, the finest Dutch animal painter of his day, described the horse with scrupulous attention to physical detail: the glossy sheen of its coat and mane, the watery moistness of its eye, and the sleekly elegant lines of the animal's body. At the same time, the artist imbued the horse with an individualized personality that combines wildness with acute sensitivity. Indeed, the animal seems to respond to the distant sound of the hunt transpiring in the middle distance.The meaning of the painting is twofold. It is probably a horse portrait, perhaps commissioned by the owner of the country house at the right. The closely observed rendering of this domestic animal implies the pride of ownership that a wealthy Dutch landowner might have taken in the possession of such livestock. On the other hand, the horse is untethered and seems to roam free. His immaculate grooming and position before cultivated fields, however, imply that the source of Dutch prosperity lay in the control that humans were able to exert over brute nature.","14 5 8 x 20 5 8 in.","Marble","American","Adolescent I","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11111401.jpg","Camillo Miola","84.XM.153.21"

He based the composition for this drawing on an engraving by Marcantonio Raimoni after Raphael'sParnassusfresco in the Vatican, placing the figure of Apollo to the left of the center. The semi-circular arrangement of the other figures draws the viewer's eye around the scene and up through the trees to the putti in the air. The soft washes contrast with the fine pen lines, giving the drawing a lively sense of three dimensions.","64 x 54 1 2 in.","Gilt bronze","American","Tabernacle Door with the Crucifixion","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00148701.jpg","Lisette Model","84.XM.153.17"

I avoid confusion, which is contrary and opposed to my nature, just as light is opposed to the darkness.Thus Nicolas Poussin explained his tendency to balance and choreograph even the violence and haste inherent in his narrative subjects. In drawings such as this one, he worked out the structure of a composition using clear strokes that captured the figures' essential gestures or shapes. He then toned down the movement, gesture, and tumult in the final painting. This is a typical development for most painters, but one even more conspicuous in Poussin's work. He made this study and at least five others in preparation for a painting commissioned by a member of an illustrious Italian family prominent in government and civic affairs and active patrons of the arts.","7 x 6 7 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Peanut Vendor, Nice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04246501.jpg","Lisette Model","84.XM.153.45"

It may show his initial steps in developing the final composition of the painting, commissioned by Cardinal Richelieu, an important art patron and chief minister for Louis XIII. Using simple oval forms for bodies and heads and lightly sketched limbs, Poussin worked out the spatial relationships among the figures. He changed the arrangement in the final painting but kept the two seated nymphs and the triton with a fluttering piece of drapery.","25 3 16 x 30 5 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Circus Man, Nice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04245801.jpg","Lisette Model","84.XP.124.18"

He executed the draped torso and the sandaled foot with a similarly spare technique and attention to structure. He might have sketched the mirror from life, as it may have been in a Roman nobleman's collection, and he probably sketched the tripod in the upper left corner after a drawing in another collector's  Paper Museum.

The ordered composition and clear, golden light contribute toA Calm'sutter tranquility, while glowing, gem-like colors and fluid paint strokes enliven this scene of benevolent nature. Poussin's sketching campaigns in the Roman countryside with his friend and fellow landscape painter Claude Lorrain account, in part, for its fresh observation of cloud-scattered sky and grazing goats.Poussin painted a pendant to this painting,Landscape with a Storm,now in a museum in Rouen. Together their contrasting weather effects embody nature's changing and unpredictable relationship with man.

The Virgin Mary sits in the center, but the action focuses on the embrace shared by Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. To the left, Saint Elizabeth gazes steadily at Mary, perhaps foreseeing her future suffering. Saint Joseph leans against a wall and smiles approvingly at the scene below.Putti or infant boys pay homage to Christ by bringing gifts.

Her eyes were originally inlaid in a contrasting material, and she would have worn earrings.This Roman statuette copies on a smaller scale one of the most famous Greek statues ever made. About 350 B.C. the Greek sculptor Praxiteles carved a cult statue of the goddessAphrodite, the first full-scale female nude in Greek art. Praxiteles' statue became extremely popular, especially in theHellenisticand Roman periods, capturing the attention of both writers and artists. Although the original statue does not survive, its popularity led to a huge production of copies and variations on the theme, so that today more nude Aphrodites survive than any other single ancient statue type.The idea of the goddess caught in a private moment follows a certain voyeuristic tradition in Hellenistic art, and part of the statue's appeal was clearly erotic. The gesture of the goddess's right hand is ambiguous, drawing attention to her pubis and concealing it at the same time. Roman writers such asPlinydid not hesitate to point out the overtly sexual reaction that Praxiteles' statue produced in viewers.","114 x 62 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Fountain, Rome","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04250601.jpg","Lisette Model","86.XM.722.5"

He used light hatching to give texture and to create shadows, and quickly sketched the position of the wings.Preti created this work as a preparatory study for a fresco in the cupola of the church of San Biagio in Modena, Italy. In that church, a nearly identical angel hovers over a window on the rim of the cupola, directing his trumpet towards Saint Jerome. Knowing that Preti finished his work on the frescoes in the church by March 1652, scholars guess that this drawing was finished sometime before this.

Mattia Preti used strongchiaroscuroto contrast the partially illuminated, startled faces of the crowd with the determination of Clorinda's shadowed profile.

The background figure, possibly an assistant or another version of Vulcan, reinforces the dramatic sense of impending movement. A broken, twisting outline artfully defines the figures and reveals an abstract beauty. Primaticcio may have intended to emphasize only the main lines of the design, for he barely noted the figures' interior modeling: short, expressive pen lines suffice, combined with subtle shadows and highlights.Primaticcio made this drawing as a preparatory study for the Ulysses Gallery at Fontainebleau, which he designed and Nicol dell'Abate and others executed. The Ulysses Gallery was entirely destroyed in 1739, and knowledge of it today depends on such preparatory drawings, copies, and written descriptions. Vulcan sat in one of the corners of the ceiling's second bay, making armor for Ulysses.

He added broad strokes of white chalk to give her hair greater luminosity. Additional subtle white chalk provides highlights on her skin, whose tone is largely carried by the brown paper. His grace and soft technique follow in the tradition established by Correggio.On theverso, Procaccini modeled a smooth female torso that suggests the coolness and idealism of sculpture. Trained as a sculptor himself, Procaccini used his experience to render three dimensions on paper.

The woman in the painting, titledThe Happy Mother,gazes adoringly at her nursing infant. Following the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who popularized and glorified maternity as a natural physical and emotional bond, both artists portrayed feminine tenderness. Such emotion set Prud'hon's imagery apart from hisNeoclassicalcontemporaries. Prud'hon preferred to draw with powdery applications of black and white chalk on blue or gray paper. Instead of using lines, he indicated contours of forms by stumping. Building up form by gradations of light created with white chalk, he explored the play of light on flesh.","44 1 2 x 57 1 2 in.","Oakveneeredwith mahogany and ebony;giltbronzemounts;griotte de Flandremarble top","French","Rolltop Desk","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00607701.jpg","Jacques Gaultier","MS. 78, RECTO"
"1410","This manuscript contains the texts used for masses on important feast days in the liturgical year, such as Christmas, Easter, and the Assumption of the Virgin. The manuscript's small scale suggests that a layperson used this book to follow along with the masses, and it was likely once part of a larger devotional text, probably a book of hours.Most of the mass texts begin with an image depicting the event from Christ's life or the saint that the feast celebrates. Many of the manuscript's miniatures were painted by the Pseudo-Jacquemart de Hesdin, who most likely worked at the court of Jean, duc de Berry from around 1380 until about 1410. The vibrant color palette, the soft modeling of figures, and the delicate gold ivy-leaf borders on each page in this manuscript are common both in the Pseudo-Jacquemart's work and in International style illumination from Paris.","22 1 16 x 29 5 16 in.","Painted and gilded oak and walnut; with abrche d'Alepmantelpiece; modern mirrored glass","French","Paneling","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00616501.jpg","Johannes Andreas Beo","39 3 8 x 31 3 4 in."

"1690 - 1705","Psiax has been called an experimenter because of his work in many different varieties of vase decoration during the late sixth century B.C. This red-figure cup may be the first preserved example of a cup with a figuralfriezeon the outside instead of an eye-cup scheme, as in the Brygos Painter'sWine Cup with the Suicide of Ajax.On both on the interior and the exterior of the cup, Psiax painted erotically charged encounters between youths and men, and males and females. What makes this vase different is that he used incision and added-white in hisred-figure techniqueas well as added-red colors. On this cup, these techniques are joined by an extensive use of added-clayrelief. Thus, the lyre on side A has arms and a cross-piece painted in added color, much of which has flaked off, incised strings, and a raised sound box added in clay (now chipped). The leftmost youth sits on a camp stool which the artist added in clay relief. It has white hinges and is topped by what was once a red cushion. The surface of what was once apparently a brightly colored vase, perhaps enhanced withgilding, is now the beige color of the clay.","10 13 16 x 16 7 16 in.","Watercolor over pen and gray ink","French","View of Civitavecchia with the Harbor Wall","www.getty.edu art collections images l 25677901.jpg","Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory","86.DD.645"

These objects, as well as the nebris or animal skin that she wears over one shoulder, identify this woman as amaenad, a female follower ofDionysos, the god of wine. A Dionysiac interpretation applies also to the flute-girl on the front of the mastos, who might be imagined playing for the god and his entourage, or perhaps for the humans honoring the god at asymposiumor drinking party.A mastos was designed for use at just such a symposium. The mastos was a relatively rare cup shape produced by Athenian potters only in the later 500s B.C. The shape fit in with the erotic pleasures of the symposium. Although the nipple on this mastos has been reconstructed, the potter would originally have put a pellet or bead into the nipple so that it rattled as the cup was being used, providing further entertainment.","7 5 16 x 7 in.","Wool and silk; modern cotton lining","French","Tapestry: The Collation from The Story of the Emperor of China Series","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00666401.jpg","Beauvais Tapestry Manufactory","99.DD.29"

The imagined walls of the schoolroom are hung with musical instruments and athletic equipment: lyres, string bags with knucklebones, sponges, andaryballoi. The scenes on this cup are not purely educational, however. On one side of the vase, a boy holds a hare on his lap, while on the other, a man offers a hare to another boy. In addition to serving as a classroom, the gymnasion in its role as the center of Greek physical and intellectual life was also the center of romantic courtship.

"1530","On a simple stage set, an actor costumed as an old man removes the lid of a chest to reveal a bizarre child with a ram's head and a large erection. Looking bewildered, a second old man clasps the child's wrist. This strange scene probably represents a theatrical parody of the mythical birth of Erichthonios. In the myth, Hephaistos, the craftsman god, believing that the goddess Athena was attracted to him, attempted to have sex with her. When she resisted, some ofHephaistos'ssemen fell on her leg. She wiped it off with a piece of wool and threw it away, accidentally impregnating Ge, the earth. Athena cared for the resulting infant and kept him in a sacred basket on the Athenian Akropolis. In the theatrical version depicted on this vase, the elaborate doorway at the left of the stage probably representsAthena'stemple, and the ram's head on the child refers to the wool in the story.The scene on the front of thisApulianred-figurebell-krater depicts a phlyax play, a type of farce parodying mythology, popular in the Greek colonies in South Italy in the 300s B.C.

Accompanied only by his sacred bird the eagle and loosely covered only by a voluminous sheath, Jupiter focuses his eyes on the distance, lending a rare psychological tension to this unusually large bronze.Inspired by a famous ancient marble sculpture of Jupiter formerly in the Giustiniani Palace in Rome, the artist, possibly Jean Raon, retained theclassicalcontrappostopose: a relaxed but mobile body with opposed limbs. Jupiter raises his right arm and holds the left akimbo and stands with one leg forward and one back. Departing from his model, the artist emphasized the god's elegance and idealized anatomy. The bronze's glossypatinaallows the light to play gently over the figure's cascading drapery and the smoothly defined muscles of his chest and arms. Although the model was made about 1670, the sculpture was not cast in bronze until about 1680 to 1700.

"1723 - 1725","Oscar Rejlander's photograph could be read as a metaphor of his own career. The additional  brush  or image-making tool provided by photography to painters was evident from the beginnings of the medium. Many early practitioners arrived at photography from painting, as did Rejlander. Photographs were often thought of and used as sketching tools for painters. Although photographs never managed to signal the death of painting as initially predicted, they did frequently assume the function that drawing had traditionally held in relation to painting.Compositionally, this is an unusual photograph. Rejlander employs anarrativedevicefrom painting: the use of figures, or parts of figures, asallegoricalrepresentations for ideas. A very young child represents the infant medium of photography. The Painter appears only as a hand extending into the frame at the upper left, although the traditional arts are also represented by the sculpture reproduction in the lower left corner. The Infant Photography, identified by the camera on which the child supports himself, faces away from the camera, his features totally obscured. The mirror behind the child gives a clear reflection of Rejlander at his camera, making this image.","10 7 16 x 7 1 2 in.","Albumen silver print","American","Female Nude","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04843901.jpg","Flix Jacques Moulin","87.DE.25"

He presented the eyes as dark caverns, with shadows alone defining the ear, cleverly allowing the blank paper to do the rest. Broad pen strokes develop areas such as the neck, shoulder, and back of the head.Rembrandt often preferred to draw and paint older figures, subjects whose greater life experiences showed in their faces.

A warm light that accentuates the tonal contrasts and rich textures of the velvet and satin fabrics bathes the two figures. Light catches and shimmers off the precious stones of the boy's gold jewelry. Fine, precise brushstrokes enhance the overall impression of softness.The subjects are presented in the guise of historical personages, possibly portraying the youthful Old Testament prophet Samuel with his instructor Eli.

"1893","Using only pen and ink, which shows every mistake, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn created the space and volume of an artist's studio with a spare use of line. He drew the easel and the painting first, as the point of reference for the artist and the other objects. He later added the perspective lines that converge beyond the right edge of the paper; they served to confirm his intuition about the correct construction of objects in space. The heavier reinforcing lines at the bottoms of the chair and easel indicate adjustments to their placement.Some scholars have labeled this drawing as a self-portrait in which Rembrandt himself views a panel from a distance, developing a mental image of the whole picture before he begins to work. Alternatively, other scholars argue that it depicts Rembrandt's friend and fellow Leiden artist Jan Lievens, who began his pictures by making a rough sketch in paint directly on the canvas.","4 1 8 x 4 in.","Tin-glazedearthenware, polychrome enamel decoration","Spanish","Plate","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00680201.jpg","Jan Harmensz.

Here he conveys a narrative story through dramatic gesture and visual effects. Bewildered, Europa grasps the bull's horn, digs her fingers into his neck, and turns back to look at her companions on the water's edge. One young woman falls to the ground and raises her arms in alarm, dropping the flower garland intended for the bull's neck into her lap, while her friend clasps her hands in consternation and watches helplessly. The carriage driver above rises to his feet and stares at the departing princess in horror. In the background, a city shrouded in mist extends along the horizon, perhaps serving as an allusion to the ancient city of Tyre as well as to contemporary Amsterdam.The dark thicket of trees to the right contrasts with the pink and blue regions of the sea and sky. Sunlight breaks through the clouds and reflects off the water, but the sky behind the trees is dark and foreboding.A master of visual effects, Rembrandt took pleasure in describing the varied textures of sumptuous costumes and glittering gold highlights on the carriage and dresses.","15 3 4 x 19 9 16 in.","Black chalk, pen and brown ink, and brownwashheightened with whitebodycolor, on light brown paper","Spanish","Embracing Couple (Mercury and Lara )","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00018101.jpg","Edvard Munch","9 x 7 5 16 in."
"1600","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn communicated the emotional exchange between these two people with economy and force. He clearly demonstrated the man's stern admonishment as he turns to face the woman's darkened gaze. Concentrating on both faces and the man's hands--the carriers of the drama--Rembrandt used only a few calligraphic strokes to describe the pair's clothing and give them a sense of three-dimensionality. He also engaged the paper, making the blank areas as active in describing the scene as the lines themselves. Even in a rapid sketch, Rembrandt created a sense of narrative, drama, and character.Rembrandt may have depicted an early event in the Old Testament story of the prophet Samuel. When Samuel's future mother Hannah moved her lips while silently praying to God to give her children, the high priest Eli reproached her, thinking she was drunk.","44 x 61 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","Spanish","Starry Night","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00086901.jpg","Nickolas Muray","94.GA.79"

In fact, Rembrandt used this drawing as the basis for his depiction of Eve in his drawing and subsequent etchingAdam and Eveof 1638.Rembrandt applied red chalk energetically, describing the swell of  the woman's belly with strong horizontal strokes. Vertical shading along her legs conveys her body's taut strength. He also exploited the brilliance and luminosity of the red chalk by applying whitegouacheunderneath it, particularly in the woman's arm and torso.

"1670","While imprisoned, Joseph, shown here standing to the left, interpreted the dreams of the Pharaoh's butler and baker, also thrown into jail for offending their master. Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn conveyed the moment when the baker, in a flat cap, discovers that Pharaoh will have him hanged in three days. The butler, who learns that he will be restored to his position, leans forward, hands clasped, listening intently. Joseph's predictions for these two came true, and his interpretation of Pharaoh's dream saved all of Egypt two years later.As with most of his compositional studies of religious subjects, Rembrandt probably made this drawing not as a preparatory study for a project but for its own sake. His working methods were highly experimental; he himself may have joined together the two sheets of paper that comprise this drawing. On one sheet he developed detailed studies of the butler and baker; on the other he captured Joseph with the fewest pen marks possible. Rembrandt used iron-gall ink, originally black but now faded to brown.","10 13 16 x 17 1 2 in.","Black ink and brown wash on paper","British","Orpheus Charming the Animals","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13885801.jpg","Bartolom Esteban Murillo","90.GG.137"
"1675 - 1680","Around 1640, Rembrandt van Rijn made five drawings, similar in setting and technique, of these two thatched cottages. Unlike most of his landscapes, this drawing almost entirely eschews atmospheric effects in favor of building up monumental architectural and textural forms with bold strokes of the quill pen. The larger house's monumentality and detail contrasts with the cursory jottings that compose the neighboring house and the few squiggly lines that indicate the earth.As always, Rembrandt drew only what was essential. His animated line moved vigorously across the sheet, creating rich and varied effects of texture and surface. At this point in his career, Rembrandt delighted in exploring the visual impact of varied, dense lines, as seen in the moss growing in the thatched roof of the nearest house. Rembrandt's bold quill pen work here brings to mind the work of Vincent van Gogh two-and-a-half centuries later.","35 7 16 x 45 11 16 in.","Pen and brown ink over black chalk","American","Young John the Baptist; History Scene","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00046201.jpg","Bartolom Esteban Murillo","94.GA.80"

The two areas of focus in this drawing correspond to these two main characters, as yet separated--Christ in the center and the Canaanite woman in an exchange with an apostle at the left. The onlookers behind and beneath the woman and the indeterminate projection at the left add depth and foreground to the scene.Modeling his figures with fine hatching, Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn displayed a wide variety in the width and character of his lines. Correcting and altering the composition as he worked, he partially blotted out one of the onlookers' faces and covered Christ's left hand and foot with whitebodycolor. The lightly sketched landscape at the right typifies Rembrandt's characteristic use of space and light, easily suggested with ink alone. In the 1640s, Rembrandt preferred to draw directly with pen and ink, unlike most of his contemporaries, who began their drawings with preliminary pencil or chalk sketches, then covered over those lines with ink.","22 ft. 4 in. x 19 ft. 6 in.","Oil on canvas","American","The Vision of Saint Francis of Paola","www.getty.edu art collections images l 24444701.jpg","Bartolom Esteban Murillo","94.GA.98"

Although Mark's Gospel set the scene in the courtyard of the governor's headquarters, the artist purposefully left much of the page blank, isolating the figures in a void and forcing the psychological meaning and dramatic interplay among the participants to dominate.

"1878 - 81","Around 1650 Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn made a number of pen-and-ink drawings and etchings of wooded scenes. He emphasized certain elements, subordinated others, and gave each landscape both unity and a poetic effect. Here he drew the trees with quick, thin strokes of the quill pen, suggesting their forms rather than specifically describing them. To emphasize the bulk of the tree at the left, he drew it darker and scratched through the paper's brown-tinted surface to create the white highlights.About ten years earlier, Rembrandt had begun drawing many landscapes. He roamed the area around Amsterdam, creating drawings and etchings that captured the Dutch countryside and its light and atmosphere, always with an economy of technique. As in this informal drawing, his landscapes express spontaneity and freshness while appearing like complete representations of the scenes he observed.","11 11 16 x 17 1 4 in.","Pen and brown ink and brown wash over black chalk; traces of ruled framing lines along all four edges in black chalk","Dutch","A Monk Carrying a Cross","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00048101.jpg","Dr. John Murray","85.XO.362.44"
"1878 - 1879","On his excursions outside of Amsterdam, Rembrandt van Rijn frequently followed the waterways, drawing and later etching these flat Dutch landscapes. Rather than aiming for a detailed reproduction, Rembrandt emphasized only the important elements. He eliminated parts, giving the viewer no more than was necessary to see and feel what he himself saw and felt. Even though this view along the Schinckel River is topographically accurate and scholars have identified the house with the tower, it is Rembrandt's economy of means that makes the drawing enchanting.Rembrandt suggested space, light, and atmosphere by relying on blank paper and using a few exquisitely placed accents. A delicate wash over fine, short strokes creates a blurred and luminous effect in the mass of trees. A fine dotting technique further animates this area, giving the sense of a slight breeze passing across the treetops. A few broad lines transform the foreground into river and land, and scattered strokes at the lower left embody the rushes and their reflections. Even more subtly, a passage of dots and wash leads into the far distance beyond the house at the left.","11 x 7 3 8 in.","Waxed-paper negative","French","The Emperor's Private Mosque in the Marble Palace, Agra Fort, India","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11491101.jpg","Eadweard J.

"1570 - 1575","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn made twenty-five  Indian drawings,  based on miniatures from the Mughal Empire that he saw in a Dutch collection and presumably studied over a long period. Adopting some aspects of the extremely precise manner of these miniatures--so unlike his usual loose, evocative style of draftsmanship--Rembrandt nonetheless enlivened the figures' poses by giving them more sense of action than did the Mughal style. Despite their looseness, his lines present the figures in the three-quarter body and profile head view common in Indian painting.A contemporary of Rembrandt known for his building campaigns and as a patron of art, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan is recognizable from his characteristic dress and face--and the aureole, which distinguished portrayals of Mughal rulers beginning with his father's reign. This depiction resembles the many portraits in the illustrated history that Shah Jahan commissioned of his reign. In characteristic Mughal fashion, he rather stiffly faces his eldest and most beloved son, Dara Shikoh.

"480","Made just eight years before Rembrandt's death, this painting depicts Saint Bartholomew holding a knife in his right hand, a reference to the fact that he was skinned alive when martyred. One of Rembrandt's neighbors may have posed as the model for the saint. By showing the apostle as a common man, Rembrandt gave the revered holy figure a tangible human quality, suggesting perhaps that holiness is part of daily life, a view in keeping with the religious atmosphere of mid-1600s Amsterdam.Saint Bartholomew appears pensive, almost melancholy in mood. He holds his chin as if lost in thought and his eyes seem to see beyond time. Rembrandt used a broader, freely-brushed technique typical of his late mature style. Applied with a palette knife, thick areas of paint calledimpastoare visible on the saint's forehead, nose, ears, and hands.

The furrowed skin around the bridge of the man's nose, the moistness of his eyes, and the wispiness of his mustache and beard map out the physical process of aging.","51 5 8 x 51 1 4 in.","Pen and brown ink","French","Rocky Landscape with a Waterfall","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00036201.jpg","Myson","87.XA.71.8"

The king insisted that Bel was a living god and pointed to the offerings of food and wine that Bel consumed every night. Cautiously, Daniel noted that bronze statues do not eat. Cyrus was momentarily bewildered, but the worried faces of the priests in the background confirm that Daniel has exposed their deception. This story of Daniel's dramatic exposure of the king's idol-worship derives from the apocryphal portion of the Book of Daniel.Light illuminates the figures of Cyrus and Daniel, highlighting their dramatic encounter. Rembrandt contrasted the king's grandeur with Daniel's humility. Facing out and gesturing toward the table, the lavishly attired Cyrus appears large and imposing. By contrast, the youthful Daniel seems small, and his posture suggests modesty or submissiveness before his ruler. Rembrandt evoked the exotic mystery of a pagan cult by showing only part of the monumental idol emerging from the flickering lamplight on the right. Inside the shadowy temple, light catches and reflects off the extravagant finery worn by Cyrus and the gold vessels placed atop the velvet tablecloth.","11 13 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Terracotta","French","Mixing Vessel with Youths and Horses","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01404701.jpg","Jan Mytens","8 5 16 x 6 3 8 in."

When he later painted the group asTheHoly Family Adored by Saints Elizabeth and John the Baptist, he idealized the figures more and made them more majestic to indicate their biblical importance.Using sharp, rather scratchy strokes and a somewhat irregular use of red chalk, Reni sketched the Virgin's face, the center of the group, and her foot. Artists often combined red and black chalks to suggest color distinctions associated with faces, hair, costumes, and other details. Reni's judicious use of white against the light paper gives the effect of the Virgin's drapery shimmering in the light.On the verso, Reni sketched a turban such as a sibyl might wear, with the barest indication of earrings and a scarf.","48 1 2 x 89 3 4 in.","Salt print","French","Self-Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04552201.jpg","Nadar","84.XM.436.141"

Renoir had spent the previous summer painting outdoors with Claude Monet, who encouraged him to move toward a lighter, more luminouspaletteand to indulge his penchant for luscious, feathery brushwork. Here Renoir retained something of Gustave Courbet's green-and-brown palette while choosing his subject from the sensual, lighthearted garden jaunts of eighteenth-century painters such as Jean-Antoine Watteau and Jean-Honor Fragonard, whose works he had studied in theLouvre.Unlike the images of seduction created by his predecessors, Renoir's is a fleeting moment caught by chance--middle-class Parisians immersed in nature, possibly a local park, not set before a studio backdrop. The dappled light filtering through the foliage would become a trademark of Renoir's finestImpressionistworks of the 1870s and 1880s.

"1855","Pierre-Auguste Renoir depicted the self-assured composer Albert Cahen d'Anvers, a former pupil of Csar Franck, nonchalantly smoking a cigarette at a friend's home. Traditionally, portraits of men were somber, but Renoir combined decorativeness with fidelity to his sitter's appearance. Facial hair was regarded as a powerful indicator of male sexuality, and Renoir shows Cahen d'Anvers's curled mustache echoing the wallpaper's curves, his ruffled red hair referring to the potted plant's feathery leaves. Cahen d'Anvers's authority and status are suggested through his alert, commanding gaze and details such as his elaborate cigarette holder and cravat.Renoir hoped that success in portraiture would lead to success in the wider potential market attracted by the Salon. Twenty years into his career, he had become so disenchanted with Impressionism that he called the movement a  blind alley.  He modified his style, combining the loose, painterly effects of early works such asLa Promenadewith Renaissance painting's firm contours and weighty forms. He began receiving portrait commissions, often from wealthy Jewish patrons.

Portraits of wise men were very popular in the 1600s, when there was a revived interest in ancient Greek and Roman philosophy.

Sebastiano Ricci took this subject from Livy'sHistory of Rome,first published in A.D. 14, but he showed Navius cutting a column, a more aesthetic object.Ricci pared the composition down to its dramatic essentials--two large figures making eloquent gestures--and added a recognizable setting and bystanders to create a sense of community. The slightly shadowed mother and child is a typical Ricci motif. Effectively employing the usual Roman Baroque sense of dramatic light and color, he adopted Giovanni Battista Gaulli's strong, rather hot colors for the costumes and the sky.

Andrea Briosco, called Riccio, made this sculpture while living in Padua, home to a thriving intellectual community and one of the most renowned universities in Europe. The study of ancient Greece and Rome was quite popular at the time, and Riccio combined a refined knowledge of antiquity with the Christian present, much to the delight of his contemporaries. The Virgin's dress and delicate features recall ancient Roman representations of deities. Shells, pearls, a winged putto, and a cameo decorate the crown atop her intricately arranged hair. Displaying the restless nature typical of small children, the infant Christ twists away from his mother to face the viewer.ThoughVirgin and Childwas originally a full-length statue, only the upper half now survives. Because the figures' heads are angled downward, scholars believe that Riccio made the sculpture as the devotional centerpiece of a raised altar. Now largely stripped of color,Virgin and Childwas once vibrantly painted. Originally, both figures had dark brown hair and pale skin. The Virgin wore a blue cloak over a red gown, while the Christ child wore a yellow garment.

The marble bust conveys not only the composer's visual likeness but also his character: the high forehead suggests the composer's intellect, while the distant, penetrating gaze in his eyes speaks of his artistic vision. This evocative quality derives from the idea of an artist as a divinely inspired genius, a very popularRomanticconcept.

In an age when only the wealthiest members of society could afford such expensive and fragile fabrics as silk, satin, and damask, both quality and quantity mattered. Only wealthy individuals could wear lace in the early 1700s, and fashion strictly controlled the style and the amount that was shown.

The bold and massive design of these mounts is not found on other works by van Riesenburgh, and they may have been made by a German bronze caster.

Absorbed in his devotions, he is unaware of three young women sneaking inside to steal flowers from a makeshift shrine. Above this trio, a woman on a ladder leans over a low wall and, with a long branch, taunts the praying hermit.Placed on the stone altar are a crucifix, books, an open Bible, an hourglass, a skull, and a rosary. The skull and hourglass, common symbols of the temporality of man and his creations, suggest that the building itself represents fallen greatness. Hubert Robert emphasizes the ruins' immensity by contrasting the small figures with the structure's massive columns. In the left foreground, a column shrouded in darkness runs nearly the full height of the composition. Birds roosting in the upper reaches of the lofty barrel vault reinforce the impression of the monument's vast dimensions.This small cabinet picture is one of several versions of the subject depicted by Robert beginning in the 1760s. In each of them, a monk prays beside a brick wall that has been built within the arcades of a Roman ruin. For this imaginary basilica, Robert likely drew inspiration from a contemporary print by Giovanni Battista Piranesi.","3 x 3 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Sarah Bernhardt","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04599501.jpg","Nadar","85.GB.440"

It explicitly embodies a theme that remained constant throughout his career: the interaction between living nature and aged, slightly decaying buildings. He brought many such drawings back to Paris, where they served as sources for his paintings for many years.Robert typically developedcompositionswhose effect was both picturesque and slightly imposing. This scene, drawn in red chalk, one of his favorite media, combines direct observation with the artist's imagination.

"1741","Under a bright, sun-drenched sky, the demolition of the chteau of Meudon is well under way. In the lower left, a man in a top hat directs four laborers--one clearly shirking his responsibilities. Other workmen transport stones with wheelbarrows or by hand. At center, two women and a young girl admire the ruins. Other visitors have entered the structure and gaze out from a balcony. Another young woman, holding a baby, tends to a group of children playfully lugging a cart across the littered courtyard. At the right edge, an artist with a large sheet of paper on his lap, gestures at the scene below.This diverse human activity--encompassing work, rest, and play--is dwarfed by the chteau itself, which although partly demolished, creates a strong diagonal axis through the composition. Hubert Robert also emphasizes the main structure by casting it in strong light. By contrast, many of the figures around the periphery of the composition are shrouded in shadow.Located near Versailles, with a view of Paris and the Seine River, the chteau of Meudon was once among France's finest monuments. But during the 1700s, it fell into disrepair. During the French Revolution, which began in 1789, the chteau was ransacked and it suffered further damage in a fire of 1795. It was demolished entirely in 1803. Rather than documenting the site's actual appearance in that year, Hubert Robert combined fact and fiction, depicting features that had already vanished alongside still-existing elements of the structure.","3 x 3 in.","Pastel on paper","Italian","Portrait of Monseigneur Louis Doni d'Attichy, Bishop of Riez","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11468301.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","77.PA.87"

He was a crossing-sweeper. I should never have accomplished one of my best works if I had not seen him sitting at a table in my studio, waiting, till I could talk to him. I not only saw the old man there, but mentally, the old lady, and the interior of the cottage...The old man, by his attitude and expression, gave the germ of the idea; the old lady had to be found, and the cottage built, but they appeared to me then quite visibly and solidly.When Day's Work is Doneexists in more copies than any other photograph by Robinson.

It is finely carved with bands of lily of the valley and ivy along the curved supports of the arms, while the legs and edge of the circular seat imitate caning.The Petit Trianon was given to the queen by her husband, Louis XVI, as a private retreat where she could escape from the rigid etiquette of court life. Marie-Antoinette furnished these intimate apartments, which were never seen by most of the courtiers, with exquisite furniture that reflected her own personal taste.This chair was part of a set of furniture delivered to the palace in 1787 that also included two armchairs, two side chairs, a fire screen, and a stool.

"1386","In ancient mythology, the sphinx embodies an amalgam of human, lion, and hawk body parts. The subject of this watercolor by Auguste Rodin, titled Sphinx, doesn't literally represent such a beast. Instead, the artist drew a young woman, who is standing frontally, with her arms folded.Rodin made this drawing late in his life, during a period of prodigious output. As is common in those drawings, sketchy pentimento lines appear to suggest a figure in motion. Here, though, the scribbly pencil marks may indicate that the model was partially clothed, because of the artist's inscription,  noir draperie  (black drapery).Rodin usually sketched his models without taking his eyes off the figure or looking down at the sheet of paper. In this case, the artist first incised the figure's silhouette--notably the hips and elbows--before using the pencil or the brush. Although the figure appears hastily sketched, the drawing as a whole reflects Rodin's considerable abilities as a draftsman. Details, such as the model's perfectly turned right ankle and knee, belie his considerable skills of observation. Carefully applied watercolor washes reveal Rodin's mastery of technique.Like many nineteenth-century artists, Rodin was interested in exotic subjects. Subtle clues, such as sand beneath the woman's feet and a palm tree on the horizon imply that, like the Great Sphinx of Giza, this woman is set in a time-forgotten, romanticized place. Rodin's title implies on a metaphorical level that she--or  woman  more generally--is like the sphinx, an enigmatic creature.","11 7 16 x 9 in.","Oil on panel","Italian","Mountain Landscape with River and Wagon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00055501.jpg","Charles Ngre","MS. 86, RECTO"

Signs of its military past are visible in the crenellated roofline, with alternating open spaces from which armed guards could defend the castle and shield themselves.This drawing is typical of Roghman's style in that the primary focus is the castle's architectural presence, while the landscape is secondary. The castle has a monumental quality; its chimney decorations rise to the top of the page. Sharp diagonal lines radiate from the tops of the upper-floor windows, suggesting decorative brick archways above each. Also, the drawing's sharpest details are found in the man-made structures--the castle doorway and the bridge--while the trees nearby and in the distant grove at right appear almost blurred.","9 x 6 5 8 in.","Tin-glazedearthenware","Ottonian","Armorial Plate with the Flaying of Marsyas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00117301.jpg","Nicol dell Abate","H:  6 3 4 x W:  7 3 4 x D:  4 1 4 in."

First, proud grandparents hold the infant on the day of his baptism in 1974. Then, at eleven years old, the boy is shown in a suit and tie beside his grandmother. The boy's grandfather is not included in this image, which immediately provokes questions as to his whereabouts. The likely cause of his absence can only be his death.

Around the pedestal, the attributes of an architect--T-square, compass, globe, books, and drawings--are casually placed, composing a still life.While the bust may be a portrait of an unidentified architect, the other figures areallegorical. The dog is a traditional symbol of fidelity, while the two children are symbols of their potential for instruction, referring to the moral, ethical, and utopian roles given to architects in this period.Although the use of allegory recalls tomb monuments, the piece speaks in a celebratory mode, honoring the architect with theclassicizingvocabulary of the bust form and an elevated base adorned with garlands and fretwork molding. Similarly, rather than suggesting a mournful tone, the figures' poses suggest familial intimacy, particularly the young woman's informal leaning posture and her arm around the back of the bust.The work was made in several pieces that were joined together before firing. Except for the woman's head, which is hollow, each of the figures is made of solid clay.","11 1 8 x 9 1 4 in.","Marble","French","Venus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00136001.jpg","Joseph Nollekens","87.SA.108"
"1776","In a richly brocaded robe, with rosy cheeks, shining eyes, and outstretched arms, Saint Gins de la Jara appeals to the faithful standing before him. His gestures and open mouth suggest that he is preaching. According to legend, after Saint Gins was decapitated in southern France, he picked up his head and tossed it into the Rhne River. Carried by the sea to the coast of southeastern Spain, it was retrieved and conserved as arelic. Life-sized, devotional cult objects often included glass eyes and were often made out of wood that could be painted in order to achieve lifelike results. Reinforcing the emotional experience of the faithful, such heightenedrealismtypified SpanishBaroqueart at a time when the Catholic Church sought to makeChristianitymore accessible to believers.Luisa Roldn, also called La Roldana, carved the work. The figure waspolychromedby her brother-in-law, Toms de los Arcos, who used the Spanish technique ofestofadoto replicate the brocadedecclesiasticalgarments. In this process, the area of the figure's garment was first covered ingold leafand painted over with brown paint, and then incised with a stylus to reveal the gold underneath.","6 7 16 x 8 11 16 in.","Marble","American","Three Goddesses","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11363601.jpg","Joseph Nollekens","86.DH.705"
"1728 - 1730","To test Abraham's faith, God ordered him to sacrifice his only child Isaac. Abraham bound Isaac, laid him on the altar, and drew his knife to kill him. At that moment, an angel appeared and held back Abraham's hand, saying,  Now I know you are a God-fearing man, as you have not withheld your only son from me.  Giulio Romano captured the scene's drama through the energetic swoop of the angel that hovers over Abraham's head. Abraham peers up astonished, while Isaac cowers on the stone altar. The figures all have squat, stocky proportions, broad faces, and hair and beards composed of solid, horn-like locks and curls. Some scholars speculate that Raphael, Giulio's master, may have begun the drawing, allowing his student to finish it. The drawing was probably made in preparation for a print. The artist used a stylus to outline the scene at first, then fleshed out the composition more fully in red chalk. An existing engraving corresponds in size and detail to this work.","5 1 2 x 8 1 16 in.","Marble","American","Minerva","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00136101.jpg","Joseph Nollekens","86.DH.705.1"
"1728","Giulio Romano set Christ and John the Baptist's first meeting on the day of the traditional Jewish purification ceremony, forty days after John the Baptist's birthday. The meaning of this enigmatic painting is unclear, and it has been known by several titles. At right a woman carries a basket with two turtledoves, the required offering of the poor. After the purification ceremony, at which the priest recognized Christ's destiny, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus visited her cousin Elizabeth and John the Baptist, Elizabeth's son. Precociously, Jesus opens a book, showing that his birth signaled the debut of a new era. The scroll, one of the Baptist's attributes, readsEcce Agnus Dei(Behold the lamb of God).As Raphael's most important protg, Giulio adapted Raphael's late style in the darkly evocative landscape and these tightly interlocked figures and idealized female faces. Features typical of Giulio's work include the metallic palette, muscular figures with heavy features, and lively details such as the dog dashing out the doorway at left and theall'anticalandscape at right.","8 3 8 x 6 1 8 in.","Marble","American","Juno","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00136201.jpg","Jean-Antoine Nollet","86.DH.705.2"

Others circle above her holding in their hands such attributes as a globe, a lute, and a wreath. The god Mercury, identifiable by his winged helmet, hovers in the upper right corner.Giulio Romano produced this design as a study for his patron Federico II Gonzaga's Palazzo del T, outside of Mantua. Intended to glorify Federico and his reign, it presents the central ceiling fresco of an addition to the palazzo. The numerous pentimenti in the drawing show that Giulio continued to experiment with the arrangement of the figures. For example, the right arm of the woman with a wreath was originally extended, holding a book. The figure on the far left, whose left arm reaches towards the center, was originally drawn slightly higher.","9 1 4 x 6 7 8 in.","Wood painted withvernis Martin;papier mch; printed paper; bronze","American","Pair of Globes","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00679301.jpg","Jean-Antoine Nollet","97.XM.78.21"
"1930s","In a canvas filled with half-naked, twisting bodies, the story of Bacchus's birth unfolds in a typically wry Mannerist comment on the perils of passion. On discovering that the chief god Jupiter had impregnated the young mortal Semele, his wife Juno hatched a plan to end their love affair. Disguised as Semele's nurse, and knowing that Jupiter's lightning and thunder were lethal, she persuaded Semele to ask Jupiter to visit  in all his glory.  Here, as Semele gives birth to Bacchus, who is caught by nymphs, as she herself is consumed by flames. From the top of the clouds, Juno looks apprehensively at her thunderbolt-carrying husband.Giulio Romano and his workshop originally painted this scene as part of an erotic series of mythological love stories for Federico Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. Giulio probably did not execute the series by himself, though he probably designed them and painted selected parts.","9 x 6 1 4 in.","Wood painted withvernis Martin;papier mch; printed paper; bronze","Italian","Terrestrial Globe","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00679401.jpg","Jean-Antoine Nollet","97.XM.78.18"
"1933","Two Roman gods and a goddess, accompanied by a Victory, peer down from the edge of a bank of clouds. On the left, holding a large key, is Janus, the guardian of the doorways of houses and city gates. He is traditionally portrayed with two faces, demonstrating his ability to look both ways at once. In the center, the bearded figure of Chronos personifies Time. In one hand he holds a scythe, while a snake gripping its tail in its mouth wraps itself around his neck. Such a snake holding its tail was an ancient Egyptian symbol of eternity. Gaea, the goddess of the Earth, crouches at Chronos's feet with another snake grasped in her right hand. The winged figure of Victory, her hair streaming out to the side, stands behind these three and holds out a crown in her left hand.Giulio Romano made this drawing in preparation for part of the frescoed vault of the Sala dei Giganti (Room of the Giants) in the Palazzo del Te, the summer residence of the court of Giulio's patron, Federico Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. Giulio completed the preparatory drawings for the fresco, and his assistants then squared them for transfer to the ceiling.","11 7 16 x 8 3 16 in.","Wood painted withvernis Martin;papier mch; printed paper; bronze","Italian","Celestial Globe","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00679501.jpg","Dorothy Norman","97.XM.78.5"
"1934","While the winds belch fire, Jupiter opens the mortal womb of his lover Semele with a thunderbolt and snatches forth the baby god Bacchus. His love for Semele had enraged his wife the goddess Juno, who swore to destroy her. Disguised as Semele's old nurse, Juno tricked Semele into asking Jupiter to come to her in all his splendor. Thus Jupiter's godly presence set Semele's frail human body on fire. After Giulio Romano completed this preparatory drawing, it was squared so that his assistants could copy it onto another surface. Inventories show that Giulio made a painting with a similar subject for the ducal palace in Mantua to celebrate the birth of a  Gonzaga prince in 1533, the son of Giulio's patron Federico Gonzaga. He may have made this drawing as a study for another painting of the same subject, now in the Getty Museum.","8 5 8 x 6 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Alfred Stieglitz Spotting Portrait of Dorothy Norman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11384401.jpg","Dorothy Norman","97.XM.78.20"
"1946","The muscular Greek god Hercules leans back to rest after completing the second of his twelve labors. King Eurystheus had ordered him to kill the monstrous, seven-headed hydra, a water-snake that ravaged the countryside. As soon as the hero cut off one head, however, two more appeared in its place. With the help of a companion, Hercules finally killed the creature by cauterizing the necks with a burning torch. Giulio Romano showed Hercules resting triumphant, with the hydra heads strewn around his feet. He holds his club under one arm and grasps the end of a torch in the other, while his bow and quiver of arrows hang from the tree behind.This drawing does not relate to any known work. Some scholars have suggested that Guilio may have used it as a preparatory study for a print, while others believe he may have made it for a painting project commissioned by his patron, Ercole d'Este. The soldier Ercole was often associated with his namesake Hercules, the personification of strength and courage.","5 13 16 x 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","Italian","Alfred Stieglitz, New York","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11384101.jpg","Dorothy Norman","85.PB.310"
"1560s","This wall clock design with an ornate gilt bronze case and bracket was popular in France; artisans produced such examples for nearly twenty years through the 1740s and 1750s. In the corner of the Getty Museum's pastel painting by Maurice-Quentin de la Tour from around 1740 sits a similar model in the form of a clock, on top of a cabinet. The Getty Museum's example can be dated to about 1758 because one of the movement's springs is inscribed with this date.Scholars believe that Charles Cressent, one of the greatestbnistesof the 1700s, designed the elaborate gilt bronze and enameled metal case of this clock. Stringent guild regulations prohibited Cressent from gilding and chasing this design himself as he was a cabinetmaker and not a member of the bronze caster's guild. However, by veneering the wooden sides of this clock with metal and then attaching the gilt bronze mounts on top, he could successfully avoid prosecution.","9 1 16 x 5 3 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Alfred Stieglitz, An American Place, New York","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11382801.jpg","Dorothy Norman","72.PA.16"
"1630s","Cristoforo Roncalli's comprehensive understanding of the human form is evident in this sensuous drawing of an angel, whose idealized grace and beauty convey his divine status even more powerfully than his wings do. Striding across a cloud and holding an open book, the figure looks upward as if receiving a sacred message. Swirling strokes defining his tousled hair contrast with the parallel lines used to shade the wings. The figure's expressive movement and gesture, captured in a characteristic Mannerist contrapposto pose, effectively convey an unearthly power.Though the drawing is not associated with any known painting, scholars believe it was made as a preparatory study for a larger project. Three studies of a male nude falling on his back, drawn on the verso of the sheet, provide a clue about this possible undertaking. The verso studies show how Roncalli worked out his composition forThe Conversion of St. Paul, a fresco he executed at a chapel in Rome in 1586. It is possible that the angel was drawn for the same chapel; however, large sections of the painting are now missing due to damage and deterioration. Both the angel and the studies of the falling figure show Roncalli's extraordinary ability to capture the unrestrained rhythm and energy of the body.","8 1 4 x 6 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen, An American Place","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11384301.jpg","Nosadella","94.GA.96"

Although somecompositionsof the subject also include a crowd of bystanders, Phillip Roos limited his design to the essential figures, thereby focusing attention on the central body ofChrist. Roos's frenzied dark lines contribute to the scene's power and drama. He outlined the cross, figures, and drapery using pen and brown ink, before adding sweeping strokes of graywashto heighten the stormy atmosphere. Scholars previously thought that Roos drew only landscape and animal studies, yet this sheet shows him capable of managing complex figure compositions. As he prominently signed and inscribed the workinvinit,a Latin phrase meaning to invent or design, Roos himself was obviously proud of this drawing.","6 5 8 x 8 1 2 in.","Oil on panel","American","Holy Family with Saints Anne, Catherine of Alexandria, and Mary Magdalen","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00089101.jpg","Pietro Novelli","2004.84"

Similarly, the cornucopia is usually shown facing upward; by depicting it overturned, Rosa expressed reckless extravagance.The beasts, portrayed with stark realism, trample the attributes of art and learning, including books and apalette. Draped in the cardinal red of the Catholic Church, an ass shields an owl, the symbol for wisdom, from the light. Bitter over his exclusion from papal patronage, Rosa included personal references: a book bearing his monogram and a pig stepping on a rose, which alludes to his name.As a satire of Pope Alexander VII's nepotistic artistic patronage, this painting nearly sent Rosa to prison.

All eyes are on one man in particular, who confidently leans against the shop window, one hand in his pocket, the other gesturing animatedly. This photograph was made in a working-class neighborhood in the Lower East Side in 1938, during the worst year of the Depression. The subjects' well-dressed appearance suggests that they are probably employed. The woman seated in the doorway beside the candy store, entertained by activity along the street, conveys the sense of dejection that many felt during this time.

By the early Middle Ages, the columns of numbers were usually assembled within painted architectural structures. Though Roslin used this traditional format in all of his pages, he endlessly varied the ornamental designs andnaturalisticelements, imbuing each page with individuality and vitality.Armenia established its own independent church in the 300s, distinct from both the Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions. In medieval Armenia, religious books such as this one were believed to serve as heavenly intercessors for those involved with the books' creation, patronage, or restoration;Gospelbooks are among the most sumptuous of Armenian manuscripts.","9 x 6 1 4 in.","Albumen silver print","Italian","Desert Sand Hills near Sink of Carson, Nevada","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04674701.jpg","Timothy H.

"520 - 510","Like the othercanon tablepages from the Zeyt'un Gospels, thisilluminationis notable for its busy decoration, varied color, and architectural structure. Some of these features recall the characteristics ofByzantinechurch architecture as discussed in literature. The Byzantine author Procopius, for example, described the great church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) in this way:  Who could recount the beauty of the columns and marbles. . . . For one would surely marvel at the purple hue of some, the green of others, at those on which the crimson blooms. . . . And so the visitor's mind is lifted up to God. . . . In this canon table, which is heavily indebted to Byzantine art, Procopius's aesthetic of colorful variety instilling wonder in the viewer was surely still at work. The diversity of hue--green, blue, orange, gold, and pink--and the foliate decoration of the framework surrounding the text must have suggested a similar heavenly context to themanuscript'sreaders.","8 7 8 x 6 1 8 in.","Terracotta","American","Wine Jug with a Drunken Man Singing","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01409301.jpg","Olivetan Master","86.AE.276"
"515","All the pages of thecanon tablesfrom the Armenian Zeyt'un Gospels employ a similar architectural structure to house the concordance of the Gospels. TheilluminatorT'oros Roslin also consistently used small-scale jewelry-workmotifs, here the four-part flowers, zigzags, and enamel-like shading that fills in the attic supported by the columns. To the sides of the architectural framework, scrollwork rises from horns of plenty. The upper ones in particular recall the balanced spiraling vines seen in western EuropeanGothicilluminations. The appearance of a western motif such as scrollwork provides evidence of the complexity and richness of resources available to Roslin. The artist's treatment of the columns and capitals here is different from those on other pages. The mazelike patterning on the columns and the looseness of the handling of the leaves on the capitals denies the structural stability of the architectural supports.","8 5 8 x 6 1 4 in.","Temperaand gold onparchment","American","Initial B: Four Saints","www.getty.edu art collections images l 25318401.jpg","Oltos","82.AE.14"

Although born wealthy, he zealously supported the poor and participated in a revolution against tyrannical leadership but refused an invitation to become king.French engraver Ren Boyvin used this drawing as the basis for his print of Empedocles. The outlines show that Boyvin traced it with a stylus for transfer; the resulting printed image is a reverse of the drawing.

"1712","The wide, smooth river Loing, a branch of the Seine, wraps around the Forest of Fontainebleau, located fifty miles south of Paris. In this drawing Thodore Rousseau focused on the large expanse of sky that seems to compress the land into a flat, dark band beneath it. Only a few trees and rocky outcrops project upwards, breaking the winding lines of the river and sandy banks.Rousseau produced the scene outside in the open air, near the village of Barbizon, an area popularized by the group of artists who gathered there in the mid-1800s. They came to draw and paint the region's varied topography, where lush glades of oak and beech give way to semi-deserts of sand, scrub, and pines. Rousseau was particularly fond of the Forest of Fontainebleau, producing many scenes of it for over thirty years. In this drawing, sketched near the end of his life, he concentrated more on the movement of the clouds in the sky than on the details on the land, preferring to reduce individual elements to simple patterns of light and shadow.","8 3 4 x 6 1 4 in.","Inkjet print","Italian","Untitled #11","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31457201.jpg","Catherine Opie","72.DB.40"
"1712","Thodore Rousseau thought of trees as almost human. He called his drawings of trees  portraits  and the trees themselves  beings.  His rendering of a pathway winding through an old forest demonstrates this affinity for natural entities. Zigzags of chalk and a line of trees give the hillside a rugged character, defining a downhill slope from the left side of the drawing to the lower right corner. There, Rousseau incorporated aserpentinecreek with curved lines along the right side, leading to a distant, small town with a church. At the far left of the drawing, a person stands on the pathway, providing a sense of scale and distance.The artists of theBarbizon Schoolwere among the first to paint and drawenplein air, taking their tools outdoors to create their works of art, rather than inventing a scene from memory in a studio. In keeping with the Barbizon School's techniques, Rousseau captured the essence of the trees, giving them body and form, but rendered details such as leaves minimally with short strokes of chalk. The one gnarled, old tree at left that receives special attention becomes the focus of the image.On the verso, Rousseau used graphite to sketch trees surrounding a cottage. As in the recto, the trees are drawn with few particulars, emphasizing their shape over other details.","9 3 16 x 5 11 16 in.","Inkjet print","Italian","Untitled #15","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31457401.jpg","Alexandre-Jean Oppenordt","85.SA.167.1"

The boulders, grass and broken branches in the foreground are barely suggested and the single figure making his way around the pond followed by a herd of cows is thinly sketched.Landscape painter Thodore Rousseau lived in the nearby village of Barbizon, returning often to the forest of Fontainebleau to paint. When commercial exploitation threatened the forest, Rousseau wrote to the Duke of Morny, an influential politician close to Napoleon III, to urge the preservation of the forest.During the summer Rousseau made use of a special easel and lean-to to facilitate painting outdoors. This painting belongs to a category known asdessin-peinturein which the artist notes the composition on site in chalk and thin layers of paint, and then returns to the studio to enhance particular elements and unite the composition.","9 1 2 x 6 in.","Oak and walnutveneeredwith brass and tortoiseshell; enameled metal;giltbronze mounts; glass","Greek","Long-Case Musical Clock","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00617401.jpg","Alexandre-Jean Oppenordt","97.GG.24"

A passionate and jealous woman, Medea stopped at nothing to obtain revenge, including murdering her own children.

"1690s","In a technique known by the French termcorch,three figures appear as if without skin. Drawn in luminous light brown ink, the principal figure demonstrates the muscular structure of the back, buttocks, and legs. Fascinated with the structure of the human body, Peter Paul Rubens then drew two subsidiary views of the same powerful form and a detail of the left arm from a different angle.Rubens produced this drawing sometime during an eight-year stay in Italy, and it shows the strong influence of the new approaches he learned there. The skillfully drawn forms show his complex grasp of the human body in three dimensions. The main figure's truncated right arm suggests the artist's study of brokenantiquestatues, while the surging, heroically proportioned forms and the extensive hatching of the musculature display his familiarity with Michelangelo's drawings. Scholars believe that Rubens produced this anatomical drawing in preparation for an instructional book on human anatomy, which he never published.

"1733","The boar was furiously twisting its body round and round, its jaws slavering with foam and fresh blood...the hero who had dealt the wound came up close to the animal and roused his foe to fury, before finally burying his shining spear in its shoulder.-Ovid,MetamorphosesWrapped in a flowing red cape, the warrior Meleager thrusts his spear into the shoulder of a massive boar. The ferocious creature--seemingly undaunted by a pair of hounds latched onto its bristled hide--has turned to confront head-on its human adversary. Meleager's blow will prove to be fatal to the boar, but the beast has proven itself as a fearsome foe. Beneath its imposing hooves lie the disemboweled carcass of a hound and the prostrate corpse of the hunter, Ancaeus.The story of the Calydonian boar hunt was told and retold during antiquity--most famously inOvid'sMetamorphoses.When King Oeneus of Calydon failed to honor the goddess Diana with offerings, she released a terrifying boar on his land. The king's son, Meleager, assembled a group of renowned warriors to slay the beast. Several of the huntsmen were killed or maimed before Meleager finally defeated the boar. He presented its head as a trophy to his beloved, the huntress Atalanta, who is seen behind Meleager, with bow in hand.Peter Paul Rubens created this painting a few years after an extended stay in Italy. He drew from ancientsarcophagiand statues he had seen there for the poses of many of the figures. For example, the boar seen in profile was taken directly from a well-known marble in Florence's Uffizi Gallery. Rubens's appropriation of iconic images fromantiquitywas intended to resonate with learned viewers. For the figures on horseback, Rubens borrowed from hisRenaissancepredecessors, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael. But Rubens's dynamic and inventive interpretation of the hunt was wholly his own. With this painting, he established the theme of the epic combat between man and animal, a subject to which he would return throughout his career.","11 9 16 x 9 in.","White marble medallion mounted on a bigio antico marble base","French","Portrait Medallion of Pope Alexander VIII","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00146501.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Oudry","2002.52.2"

Mary, the mother of Christ, cradles his head and looks heavenward for divine intercession.TheEntombmentwas meant to make the viewer's religious experience personal and encourage the faithful to imagine the physical horror of Christ's Crucifixion. Christ's tortured features confront the viewer, and our attention is focused on his corpse, sacrifice, and suffering. Wounds are openly displayed: blood flows from the gaping laceration in Christ's side and the puncture wounds on his hands. Rubens contrasted the living and the dead by juxtaposing the lifeless body and green-tinged skin of Christ with the healthy complexion of St. John.This painting was probably made to serve as analtarpiecein a small chapel, perhaps one dedicated to the Eucharist. The slab on which the body is placed suggests an altar, while the sheaf of wheat alludes to the bread of the Eucharist, the equivalent of Christ's body in theMass.","9 1 4 x 6 5 8 in.","Brush and black ink and graywashheightened with whitegouacheon blue paper","American","The Plague-stricken Animals","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13815601.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Oudry","2002.52.4"

A friend since childhood, Balthasar Moretus would in his later years write of Rubens,  I loved this young man who had the most perfect and the most amiable character. Theassumption of the Virginwas a subject to which Rubens repeatedly returned throughout his career. In this version, the controlled,classicalcompositionechoes one of Titian'saltarpiecesof the same subject. The bravura style ofBaroqueItalian painters also influenced Rubens's ebullient and dramaticallyforeshortenedputti.Rubens began drawing in chalk, which he then covered over with pen, ink, andwash. The chalk underdrawing contains severalpentimenti,which are most obvious in the figure of the Virgin. These changes of mind, as well as the indents for transfer onto the plate are probably evidence that this drawing was the final of several studies, not the final sheet from which the engraver would work.","9 9 16 x 7 7 16 in.","Brush and black ink, graywash, heightened with whitegouache, on blue paper","American","The Eagle and the Magpie","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13815701.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Oudry","87.GB.13"
"1744","Peter Paul Rubens created this drawing to be engraved for a new edition of theBrevarium Romanum,the Catholicprayer bookorbreviary.

He then used whitebodycolorto suffuse the onlookers in theChristChild's miraculous holy light, a concept ultimately derived from Correggio's art.In this sheet, Rubens's drawing betrays an artist who thinks primarily as a painter, softening outlines and building up shapes that then take on life and color. Even in this very finished drawing, he characteristically sacrificed detail to gain a sense of movement and energy.For twenty-five years, Rubens supplied his boyhood friend Balthasar Moretus, head of Antwerp's Plantin Press, with illustrations for books ranging from the philosophy of Seneca to a treatise on optics. Moretus informed him well in advance about the illustrations required; during this time, Rubens jotted down many ideas that he worked into designs for engravings, as in this drawing.","9 1 4 x 5 1 8 in.","Brush and black ink, graywash, heightened with whitegouache, on blue paper","American","The Wolf and the Fox","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13816001.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Oudry","96.GB.19"
"1744 - 1747","While this wagon recurs in several paintings, Peter Paul Rubens may have intended this drawing as an independent work of art, rather than a study.

The sharpperspective, unusual rear view, and lack of alignment between front and rear axles draw the viewer into the space. The splayed side rails and wheel spokes all thrust outward in repeating lines, charging the stationary wagon with energy. Rubens's experiments with different positions for the rustic wagon and the farmer's flail further increase the effect of motion and symmetry.Rubens varied both his materials and his technique to give the scene immediacy and vigor. The man's red shirt adds to his sense of animation and becomes a focal point of the drawing. Subtlehighlightsappear in other colors of chalk: yellow inside the wagon, a bit of blue on the barn roof, and touches of brown on wagon wheels and the ground.

By liberally layering in white chalk, the artist created a sensuous play of light over the hair. Smudgy black chalk strokes give volume to another woman's body and describe the muscular ripples on her arms.

Jacob van Ruisdael, one of the great Dutch landscape painters of the 1600s, explored a range of landscapemotifsin his work, including forest scenes, seascapes, beach scenes, and panoramic landscapes. InBridge with a Sluice,Ruisdael made an ordinary object monumental by making it larger than all the other elements in the painting, thereby calling attention to its use and placement in the countryside. The diagonal movement of the rugged road at the left draws the eye up toward the sluice and then down to the land below. A single figure populates the scene, but the sluice symbolizes the human presence in nature and human attempts to control it.","5 15 16 x 4 9 16 in.","Gilded gesso andtemperaon panel","Greek","The Chiarito Tabernacle","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00089201.jpg","Pacino di Bonaguida","71.PA.32"
"1820","For Jacob van Ruisdael, decayed trees with bare, twisted branches could speak as eloquently as thriving ones. The aged tree was a long-standing theme in Dutch andFlemishlandscape imagery, but in Ruisdael's hands it became a very personal expression.Ruisdael focused thiscompositionaround a hollow tree whose bare limbs reach upward: a heroic element in the landscape. Its lifeless skeleton symbolizes the transience of human life, a favorite Ruisdael theme, and reminds viewers of the suffering and endurance required in life. Yet Ruisdael also set the dead tree amidst healthy ones, showing that both life and death have a share in nature. To balance the scene compositionally, Ruisdael contrasted the dramatic tree with a placid stream and picturesque footbridge on the left.Ruisdael began by sketching the composition in black chalk. He then brushed in a range of tones of gray wash, creating a rich diversity of textural and light effects, especially on the right.Subjects reflecting life's uncertainty and brevity were popular in post-Reformation Holland, where religious painting had nearly disappeared. Thevanitasthemes adopted by Dutch still life painters came from the same urge to record the fleeting character of nature.","11 3 8 x 8 3 4 in.","Tempera colors and gold on parchment","Greek","The Ascension of Christ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 26588001.jpg","Pacino di Bonaguida","85.AE.145"
"1250 - 1225","Jacob van Ruisdael captured the tension between nature's power and human needs. Glimpsed from the bank of a stream amid thick foliage, turbulent waters rush through an open sluice. Inclement weather is suggested by the dark clouds; uneven, craggy branches and spreading trees grow on either side of the river. Against the ominous sky, the buildings appear solid and sturdy, and a solitary male figure with his dog seems dwarfed by the natural setting. Sunlight breaks through the heavily clouded sky and settles on the centralmotifof the two half-timber thatched millhouses.When he was in his early twenties, Ruisdael traveled to Germany from his native Haarlem. He became captivated by watermills on his travels and painted a series of views featuring them as a central motif. This painting is one of six known variations on this theme and the only one that is dated.","11 3 8 x 7 1 16 in.","Tempera and gold leaf on parchment","Greek","The Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence","www.getty.edu art collections images l 28064901.jpg","Joseph Paelinck","86.AE.253"

He contrasts the uncut wheat in the field and the newly bound sheaves on the right, the broad expanse of blue sky above and the low, yellow fields below. Dwarfed by their surroundings, the small figures convey the insignificance of humanity in the face of nature.","9 1 8 x 6 1 2 in.","Oil on canvas","Greek","The Holy Family","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00064701.jpg","Painter 20","96.AE.99"

The invention and popular spread of photography coincided with the invention and expansion of the railroad in the mid-1800s; each played a significant role in the American Civil War. Railroads were vital for the Union and Confederate armies, who used them to move provisions and weaponry.

The Charles Minot steam engine was thrown from the tracks as the result of an attack by the Confederate cavalry. During the American Civil War, one of the earliest wars to be extensively photographed, much of the Union Army's efforts was directed at rebuilding bridges and railroads destroyed by retreating Confederate forces. This experience working on railroad projects was a great aid to the nation in later years, when countless well-trained Civil War veterans worked on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad. Grenville Dodge, chief engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad and former General in the Union Army, remarked favorably upon the abilities of former soldiers who undertook backbreaking railroad work:  It was the war that taught them how to think big, how to organize grand projects, how to persevere.

He photographed it, however, because engineers used such augers to bore holes in the supporting timbers of bridges for the placement of explosives.While a captain in the 141st New York Volunteers, a Union Army infantry unit, Russell worked under Union General Herman Haupt--whose experiments in military engineering are still considered quite ingenious.

Gregory, the holder of Harlaxton Manor, is shown wearing the sober, sensible garments typical of a nobleman in the early 1790s: a brown double-breasted wool coat with black collar set against a brilliant white linen cravat. In his hand he casually holds a black hat lined with glowing white satin. Gregory's hat and collar are covered with white powder from his fashionably dressed hair. He is somberly yet richly dressed, alert yet seated at ease. Gregory's decorous pose embodies Russell's ideal of depicting the sitter in a manner appropriate to his age.The portrait's brilliant whites, velvety blacks, and masterful interplay of varied flesh tones with blues are all characteristics of Russell's virtuoso application ofpastel. Russell achieved the even tonality by manually smudging broad, soft areas of crayon onto the paper. He then applied fine, linear flourishes, such as the white highlighting on the cravat and in the hat lining, with a hard, pointed crayon. Russell's technical facility and acute powers of observation resulted in an engaging representation of the sitter.","9 1 16 x 6 7 8 in.","Terracotta","French","Oil Jar with Paris and Helen","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01546201.jpg","Painter of the Wedding Procession","85.AE.88"

On the frozen canal at right, others play kolf, a cross between hockey and golf. In the distance, the delicate bare branches of the trees create black tracery against the pale sky, their round tops echoing the curve of the bridges below and arc of birds overhead.Although Rutgers used both copies and his imagination as sources for his drawings, he drew this quintessential Dutch winter genre scene from life. It is one of two drawings the artist did of the same location on different occasions. Rutgers effectively captures the chill of a winter day with crisp pen work, particularly visible in the architectural details, contrasting against the expanse of white paper and gentle grey and brown washes in the sky and bank of snow.Jisp banned construction of new thatch roofs in 1647 as a precautionary measure. The drawing can therefore be dated before 1664, when a significant fire damaged the city, and likely destroyed any thatched roofs in the city. Close observation also reveals that Rutgers used a slightly different ink to draw the figures on the left than the rest of the drawing, suggesting that he was not satisfied with his original composition and added to it at a later time.","11 5 16 x 9 3 8 in.","Terracotta","Italian","Prize Vessel from the Athenian Games","www.getty.edu art collections images l 03779201.jpg","Painter of the Wedding Procession","85.AE.89"

His variety enhances the sensuous quality of the black chalk, giving the viewer a strong sense of its texture and feel.Gaspare Redi, a copyist and mount-maker, created the ornamental frame, or cartouche. Florentine nobleman Francesco Maria Niccol Gabburri, who assembled a large series of drawn portraits and self-portraits of artists, hired them both. Gabburri probably requested that Sabatini use the oval format, which he preferred for his collection. The tradition of collectors using ornamental frames to set off their drawings began with Giorgio Vasari.

He even added analtarpieceand a stained glass window, which would probably already have been removed from the church by Saenredam's time. By the 1600s,Protestantchurches in Holland had become relatively austere in response to the teachings of theologian John Calvin.The overall impression is one of strong verticality, soaring space, and penetrating light, a spiritual reference to the heavens above. The inclusion of small figures accentuate the viewer's experience of exalted interior space.

In his studio a month later, Saenredam transformed the life study into this finely tuned, idealized drawing showing the deep vista from one of the side chapels across the nave to another. According to the inscription, he completed his painting after this drawing on October 15, 1635.Saenredam began the drawing with a series of vertical and horizontal ruled graphite lines that delineate the faces of the side piers and establish a centralvanishing point, clearly visible between the figures in the lower center.

By contrast, much of the lion's chest is covered in dark shadows where Cornelis Saftleven used black and brown wash to soften the animal's fur.Dutch artists in the 1600s could study exotic animals--like this North African lion--at fairs and markets, traveling circuses, or one of several menageries or zoos. But artists did not always have the opportunity to work from life and sometimes relied on stuffed animals or the work of their contemporaries as models. This fearsome lion's powerful and animated presence suggests that Saftleven drew it from life. The artist was fascinated by animals and produced both fanciful animalallegoriesand detailed studies of lions, leopards, owls, and monkeys.

The sparing touches of red, yellow, and blue watercolor heighten the comic subject's playful, festive quality. As he typically did, Saftleven included cooking implements and other bits carelessly strewn about and evoked a mood of enchantment by setting the scene in a shadowy vaulted interior with flying bats.

Although in this drawing he has created a natural-looking scene, many of his drawings are not topographical and he often used interchangeablemotifs. These fantastic, vaguely Central European views reflect the influence of Roelandt Savery's rugged, fictitious mountain landscapes, such as Savery'sLandscape with Waterfall, created about thirty years earlier than Saftleven's drawing.At a time when travel was difficult, landscape drawings and prints gave people both a means and an excuse to conjure up exotic, far-flung lands.

He leans against a longhoulette,a tool consisting of a narrow metal scoop attached to the end of a pole, which he would use to dig up small clods of earth, throwing them behind him to create a trail for his animals to follow. The oversized, ragged clothes he wears suggest both his youth and his poverty. The billowing folds of the frayed cape, big shoes, and peaked hat envelop the slight frame of the boy, emphasizing the poignant, shy smile on his face. In a mixture of chalk and wash, Herman Saftleven the Younger emphasized the play of sunlight and shadow over the boy's body.In the 1600s, Dutch artists first began to sketch the poor in their works of art, capturing not only their poverty, but also their rustic beauty and dignity.

Inspired by Jean-Antoine Watteau'sftes galantes,in which elegant people engage in a variety of diversions, often in an idealized park or garden setting, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin devised a similar rural subject.During the 1700s, country dances had become a popular form of summer entertainment for Parisian society. A tireless chronicler of his time, Saint-Aubin surely would have viewed these dances and theatrical performances on the outskirts of Paris. Drawing on the wit and meticulous observation seen in Dutch paintings of peasants in the 1500s and 1600s, Saint-Aubin refined the rustic folk in a characteristically French Rococo treatment.","12 1 16 x 9 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Venus and Mars","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00065901.jpg","Samuel Palmer","78.PA.363"
"1625 - 1630","Although the various drawings on this page were executed in different media and at different times, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin achieved a remarkable sense of balance and unity among the motifs. The two most prominent sketches--theBirth of Venus, a drawing after a contemporary sculpture in the upper left, and a seated woman reading in the lower right--are joined by two fascinating characters. A black-chalk drawing of a seated writer appears to float between the two larger sketches of theBirth of Venus. A drawing of a young artist at work, executed in pen and ink and red and white chalk, appears in the lower left corner.Saint-Aubin brought together many of his favorite subjects--the artist at work, women reading, and contemporary art--in a lively and engaging way on this sheet. While drawing in his sketchbook, he kept in mind the arrangement of elements, cleverly organizing the subjects so that they correspond to one another. The statue, for example, forms a visual parallel with the reading woman, as both figures look down to the right. Saint-Aubin also added an area of red watercolor on the right side of the sheet, echoing the red-chalk drawing of the artist at work and thereby balancing the composition.","11 3 16 x 8 7 8 in.","Watercolor and bodycolor, with some gum arabic, over black chalk underdrawing","Italian","Sir Guyon Tempted by Phaedria","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00043401.jpg","Giovanni Paolo Panini","84.SD.76"
"1789","The sea teems with a seemingly endless fleet of warships; a vast battle looms, ships crowd closer and closer to one another. Rows of oars froth up the sea, the frenzied water foreshadowing the impending combat. Standing at opposite ends of the two central ships are the leaders of warring factions. On one deck is the stoic Roman general Regulus, commanding his followers as they attempt to board an enemy ship. Opposing Regulus is the Carthaginian leader Hamilcar Barca, father of the famed general Hannibal. In fanciful reference to Hannibal, the Carthaginian prows are elephant heads armed with imposing ramming tusks.Gabriel Jacques de Saint-Aubin meticulously described every detail of the foreground ships. He first drew the composition in black chalk and then used pen and ink to further articulate details of the ships, such as their masts and riggings, and the myriad figures. Using a limited palette of deftly applied watercolor--gray, brown, and blue--Saint-Aubin sensitively colored the sea and sky.The first Punic War (264-241 BC) was a conflict largely fought at sea. Involving over three hundred vessels, the battle depicted here was one of the largest navel battles in history. The smaller Roman fleet defeated the Carthaginian by dividing their forces into four squadrons and waging four separate battles.This drawing is one of a series of illustrations Saint-Aubin made in the 1760s for an ambitious history of Rome. Engravings after drawings as well as maps were to accompany this multi-volume series which was never completed. In 1789, twenty-nine engraved plates from Saint-Aubin's drawings illustrated a more modest Roman history.","6 ft. 7 8 in. x 8 ft. 1 2 in.","Graywashover black chalk","Italian","Three Figure Studies","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00008001.jpg","Pietro Paolini","84.SD.194"

Samaras denies the viewers the ability to familiarize themselves with his facial features and instead emphasizes his highly detailed hand, a vital tool for making art. Thus his hand takes the place of his face and becomes a symbol of himself.Samaras repeatedly focused attention on himself in his Photo-Transformations series. He often extensively altered these Polaroid self-portraits by manipulating the surface emulsions while they were fresh from the camera and still malleable.","10 3 4 x 12 1 2 in.","Pen and brown ink, brown wash, heightened with white bodycolor","French","Figure Study","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00006301.jpg","Parmigianino","84.GA.61"

Samaras altered the print by manipulating the dyes, slightly obscuring his head and shoulders. The viewer's attention focuses on his gaping mouth, which suggests a long, desperate scream. Perhaps Samaras was trying to convey that he is frightened. Is he crying out in despair, or pain, or rage  Or is he crying out at all  This portrait seems to present more questions than answers, somewhat like the artist himself.","11 1 4 x 8 in.","Pen and brown ink with brownwash, over red chalk, heightened with whitegouache","American","Two Studies for a Holy Family","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10870401.jpg","Parmigianino","84.DE.718"

In sharp contrast to the indistinctbackgroundof his upper body, his crisply defined fingers curl forward, as if he is searching for a way to transcend a two-dimensional world of his own creation. An overriding sense of claustrophobia defines this image, underscored by the small scale of the Polaroid print. Samaras, a hermit-like person, made many Polaroid self-portraits like this in the 1970s as a means of observing himself. The images are open to a wide range of interpretation. Here, Samaras may have tried to convey the sense of isolation he experiences as a reclusive person.","11 1 4 x 8 in.","Pen and brown ink","German","Studies of the Madonna and Child (recto); Studies of the Madonna and Child and of an Architectural Detail (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00003401.jpg","Parmigianino","88.GA.109"

A picture of a life-size skeletal human is the third figure in the composition. Samaras's self-portraits are psychologically complex images that challenge viewers and defy any single interpretation. One analysis of this image could be that Samaras is asking the audience to recognize him as an artist and as an individual concerned with both interior and exterior dimensions of mind, body, and soul.","11 1 4 x 8 in.","Pen and brown ink","German","David with the Head of Goliath","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00008101.jpg","Jacques-Franois Deparis","86.GB.613"

Perhaps most striking about this portrait of three farmers walking along a country road on their way to a dance is their formal dress: each wears a hat and suit and carries a walking stick. This formal appearance removes them from the reality of their occupations.

The emergence of a white-collar workforce in Germany during the 1920s vastly expanded opportunities for such new types of salaried employees as the bookkeeper, the bureaucrat, the secretary. Although rising employment rates were a positive development, Germany's volatile financial market during this period often meant that jobs were insecure.August Sander intended this image of a stern bank clerk to be part of his portfolio entitled  The Official.  The monumental cash register and the note in his hand inform the viewer of this man's monotonous role.

Sander also made many portraits of workers in his studio, without the tools of their trade to act as props or visual clues to their profession.The original image was not so tightly arranged. Sander isolated and enlarged this detail from the original composition. One historian has noted the evocative relationship of the man's body to the space surrounding it:  By tightly inscribing his subject into the frame of his vehicle, Sander creates an image of almost claustrophobic intensity.

Working conditions in naval yards were known to be quite poor and gave rise to numerous militant uprisings; in this group image, however, each man maintains a dignified posture, a stance no doubt derived from occupational pride.Lined up shoulder-to-shoulder with their hands stuffed in their pockets, these dockworkers form an imposing barricade to the entrance of what is probably a waterfront warehouse.

August Sander made this portrait of his artist friends during the Mardi Gras carnival that was celebrated every February in Cologne.Though he was a generation older than most of the artists in the Cologne art circle, Sander developed a close friendship with many of them. He enjoyed their intellectual discussions about art and politics and benefited from their comments about his work.

"1660","In this self-portrait, August Sander, at around the age of sixty-five, enjoys one of his favorite activities, playing the lute. Aside from being a successful photographer, Sander was also an accomplished musician--he once even considered a career as a concert lute player. Sander valued the rural life and the communal ideals of pre-industrial Germany; thus it is not surprising to find that his repertoire was made up mostly of German folk songs. Nor is it surprising to learn that music was vital in the Sander household. All of the children were given extensive musical training. His eldest son and daughter played the guitar, while his youngest son was an accomplished cellist. Sander often played for friends in the Cologne art circle, who would come over in the evenings to enjoy his homemade rhubarb wine.This self-portrait also depicts Sander's library. Though not formally educated, he read voraciously, and was especially interested in the works of Goethe, Schiller, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, as well as Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann. By surrounding himself with signifiers of erudition, Sander presented himself as a learned individual and illustrated for modern viewers his veneration of high German culture.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Hard-paste porcelain, enamel decoration,gilding","French","Leaf-Shaped Dish","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00677901.jpg","Mattia Preti","94.GB.36"

"1765 - 1770","In this idyllic image of Frau Steinrcke with her child and small dog, August Sander depicted a scene of leisure specifically associated with middle-class Weimar Germany. Seated on the grass, the baby smiles at the camera while the mother gazes contentedly and the dog stands proudly beside her. The absent father is presumably at work.One scholar astutely observed that, although  Sander claimed that his photographs were primarily documentary, . . . they also inevitably articulated anxieties and desires shared by many of his contemporaries.  Germany in the mid-1920s experienced political and economic chaos. By posing a woman with her child in a landscape, Sander emphasized women's domestic role and tie to nature rather than their increasing political and wage-earning power. Perhaps because it reinforces traditional social tenets, this portrait conveys a sense of stability and calm, despite the fact that it was made during a period of fragmentation and turmoil.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Black chalk, heightened with white chalk","Italian","Portrait of a Young Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00041901.jpg","Antoine Capelle","74.DF.3"

August Sander's portrait of the artist he called a bohemian suggests that gender roles in Weimar society may have been far more fluid and complex than even he imagined.August Sander was a close friend to many of the young artists in Cologne, frequently showing his photographs in their exhibitions, or trading his images for their paintings. Indeed, Brockmann lived with Sander's family for almost two years, during which time they had numerous discussions about the political, social, and aesthetic concerns of the day.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, dark brown(fond capelle)ground color, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","Italian","Plate","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00681601.jpg","Pierre Deumier","89.GB.66"

Her vacant expression, however, suggests that she is engaged in thought or daydreaming.August Sander began acquainting himself with Cologne's art circle in the early 1920s, and he photographed many painters, sculptors, and architects. Many of his artist portraits contain samples of the subject's work; this example is rather unusual in that it does not include any of vom Rath's sculpture. Believing that an individual's face  portrayed not just the person's inner character, but also his trade, economic experience, and social position,  Sander probably felt that he could convey vom Rath's identity as an artist without representing her work. She appears to have been an assertive woman, and the prominent position of her hands-the tools of her trade- strongly hint at her occupation.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Silvered bronze,giltbronze,bleu turquinmarble top, modern marbleized wood base","Italian","Console Table","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00683401.jpg","Jean-Louis Prieur","2011.45"

The reputation of the paintings began to spread in 1644 with the publication of a Dutch poem describing them. Sandrart then made a series of finished drawings to be used as models for a corresponding series of prints.

"1555 - 1560","Amidst swirling draperies, Saint Joseph holds the infant Jesus upon a tasseled cushion. Joseph is modeled with subtle twists in his body, amplified by his buoyant and billowing tunic and cloak. Even his curly hair flutters with a life of its own. Fashioned from white-bodied earthenware, known as creamware, the figures are painted with lustrous jewel-like colors. Their theatricality is characteristic of Baroque sculpture.Athough most depictions present Saint Joseph as elderly, he is portrayed here as a youthful and handsome father. Inspired by the new focus on Jesus' human and family life and encouraged by the philosophies of the Counter-Reformation, the cult of Saint Joseph became more popular in the second half of the 1700s, when this sculpture was made.The subject and composition of this work are identical to those of a life-size marble of 1790 to 1791 by the Neapolitan sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino in the Taranto Cathedral. Sanmartino produced a number of terracotta sketches for his large-scale sculpture; this small-scale ceramic group by Gennaro Laudato probably copied one of these and was intended as a collector's object or devotional piece.","7 1 16 x 5 1 4 in.","Bronze","Greek","Double Head","www.getty.edu art collections images l 33030601.jpg","Francesco Primaticcio","83.PB.24"

Cupid sports wings and a bow and arrows in a sling over his back. Reaching up to his mother, he balances on a fantastic diving dolphin that has an almost human face. The figure of Venus is a study in contrasts: her elaborate hairstyle contrasts with her smooth flesh, and the detachment with which she takes away Cupid's arrow, now missing, disguises her passionate nature. Scenes like this one, drawn from Greek and Roman mythology, were popular in the 1600s and 1700s in France. By representing classical subjects, patrons and artists could justify depictions of the female nude and titillating images of amorous activity. Unusual holes left from the casting process in the top of Venus's head, in her right hand, and on the bottom of her feet may have been used to remove the core material. These holes may not have been visible from the work's original position and so were not disguised.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and brownwashheightened with whitebodycolor,squaredin black chalk","French","Vulcan at His Forge","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00007901.jpg","Francesco Primaticcio","86.GB.20"

He made the repouss scene of Bellerophon separately and attached it to the bezel as an appliqu. Using a link of a gold chain for the ring's hoop, he masked the join of the hoop and bezel with palmettes.Box bezel rings are rare, and this example is unique in its rendering of a complex mythological scene on the bezel. The theme of Bellerophon and the Chimaera may have been adapted from vases.

In the fresco she wears a more elaborate costume than the one in the drawing, suggesting that he based the drawing on a studio model. Artists in the Renaissance commonly used  live models as they tested out various positions in preparatory drawings. Later, they added decorative details and changed the clothing.

During the early 1600s, while in the service of Emperor Rudolph II in Prague, Savery traveled extensively in the eastern Alps, gathering many of themotifshe would use in his pictures for the rest of his life.

On the left side of the sheet, for example, a mass of inky lines silhouettes the edge of the man's face. Savoldo drew the chalk lines around the edge of his chin more lightly, giving the impression of a wispy mustache and beard that softens into the hollows of his neck and cheeks.

The swirling clouds at his knees, the pointing gesture, and the bright light around the angel's head betray Gabriel's spiritual status, for he has no wings or traditional symbols to identify him as God's messenger. Bright light illuminates Mary's thoughtful face.

The subject of a wooded mountain landscape with water in theforegroundis typical of Nauwincx, whose prints offer parallels with this scene.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Tempera colors, gold leaf, and gold paint on parchment","Greek","The Nativity of the Virgin","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00197201.jpg","Pseudo-Jacquemart de Hesdin","90.AE.122"
"520 - 510","Having just fallen off his rearing horse,Saint Paullies prostrate on the ground. His closed eyes hint at the blindness that struck him the moment thatJesusappeared in the clouds to him. From Jesus' mouth flow the words recorded in theActs of the Apostles:Saule, Saule, quid me persequeri (Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me)  The artist emphasized the drama and emotion of the moment by undercutting the horse's head and front leg and by carving Paul withforeshorteningand in the greatest depth to suggest projection into the viewer's space.Saint Paul, originally Saul, was a Pharisee who persecuted Jesus' followers until the episode depicted here. The fall, during which Jesus called upon him to take up an apostolic mission, led to his conversion and a change of name from Saul to Paul. The limewood panel depicting this pivotal moment in Saint Paul's spiritual life is paired with a panel of the PenitentSaint Peter. Together the two served as meditational images, perhaps intended for aKunstkammeror collector's cabinet. Alternatively, since sculptor Christoph Daniel Schenck often worked for monasticpatrons, the pair may have been housed in amonastery.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Temperacolors,gold leaf, and gold paint onparchment","French","The Meeting at the Golden Gate","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00197401.jpg","Psiax","2002.1"
"1650 - 1655","With remorse and anguish because he has just betrayedJesus, theapostlePeter clasps his hands and closes his eyes, clearly in torment. His deeply carved facial features and furrowed brow express his spiritual pain, as do the sway of his body and the turbulent, swirling drapery. Behind this dominating figure, sculptor Christoph Daniel Schenck includedbackgroundscenes. On the left through a window, Roman soldiers torment Jesus, while on the lower right, amplifying the context of Peter's guilt, Peter denies knowing Jesus in the midst of a group of soldiers. Above, a cock stands on a ledge, referring to Jesus' prophecy that Peter would deny him three times before the cock crowed. By carving these background scenes in low relief and in smaller scale, the artist focused attention on Peter as a penitent in a moment of confession and internal transformation. The panel depicting spiritual change and its pair, the Conversion ofSaint Paul, probably served as devotional objects for a privateKunstkammeror collector's cabinet or perhaps in amonastery.The heightened emotionalism of the pieces is characteristic of GermanBaroquesculpture. Limewood was a popular material because its relative softness and uniformity allowed the sculptor great freedom of expression in carving.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Terracotta","French","Wine Cup with a Gathering of Men, Youths, and Women","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01415101.jpg","Psiax","99.SI.51"

In the upper right-hand corner, a man is hanged in the gallows while another is tortured on the wheel.This scene portrays a pivotal moment in the story of Josaphat. As in the story of Prince Siddhartha (later known as the Buddha), the young privileged prince had wished to venture out from the confines of the palace. Unable to deny his son's request, King Avenir instructed a group of escorts to accompany Josaphat abroad and to protect him from the sight of the harsh realities of life, a Herculean task that proved to be impossible. The sight of illness and death--and the realization that these conditions were inevitable for all humans--shattered Josaphat's worldview.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Pen and black ink and black chalk onvellum","French","A Ship in a Port with a Ruined Obelisk","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14430401.jpg","Martin Puryear","71.PA.25"

Barlaam proceeds not to describe the gem and its powers, but to quote Christ's parable of the sower--recounted in the Gospels--in which only the seeds that fall on good earth bring forth fruiting plants.

Josaphat, for his part, sits deferentially at his father feet but faces those on the left who are arguing the Christian cause. To prevent any confusion about his true loyalty, the young prince holds up a processional cross in his right hand.King Avenir, hoping to return his son to the idolatrous fold, called for a debate between scholars from the two opposing faiths, agreeing with his son that they would both follow the religion that proved victorious in the debate.

This drawing commemorates that event and was probably produced in the same year. The pageantry of the whole scene seems to have been the element that most interested Erhard Schn. In this preliminary sketch for the middle block of a large three-blockwoodcut, he took great care to show many details of the costumes, the various weapons each footman carries, and the intricate embroidery, fringes, and tassels of Sleyman's canopy.","7 15 16 x 5 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","Italian","Orpheus and Eurydice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00072001.jpg","Raphael","78.PB.364"

Martin Schongauer achieved subtly gradated coloration by laying in the basic forms in a broad painterly wash and then describing the details in bodycolor, opaque water-based color, with the point of the brush. Though an outstanding example of a highly finished drawing, it was made as a study for the painting,The Madonna of the Rose Gardenof 1473, in the Dominican church in Colmar.During the late 1400s, people began to perceive the natural world in a radically different way.

"1509 - 1511","Although he was reportedly a prolific painter, this panel is one of only seven paintings by Martin Schongauer in existence today. It belongs to a group of four Andachtsbilder, or devotional paintings, created near the end of his life. In his engravings Schongauer already had explored the theme of theMadonna and Childreading a book in a niche, symbolizing the Virgin's role as Christ's tutor. Here he balanced the Madonna's serenity with the livelyChristChild and the book's fluttering pages. Her dignified face, with its polished modeling and delicate features, is typical of Schongauer, who was heavily influenced byFlemishpainter Rogier van der Weyden's art. Mary's cascade of gently flowing hair shows Schongauer's sensitivity to the expressive potential of line. His attention to detail is especially evident in the thin gold seams in Mary's cloak, the jeweled crown, and the figures' fine facial features. In thebackground, an angel holds the crown and scepter. Since the 1500s, Schongauer has been credited with bringing the advances of NetherlandishRenaissanceart to Germany. He was the main inspiration for Germany's next generation of artists, notably Albrecht Drer. Schongauer's engravings had far-reaching impact, influencing Italian artists such as Michelangelo.","34 1 2 x 19 3 4 in.","Pen and brown ink","American","Female Figure with a Tibia, and Ornamental Studies (recto); Ornamental Studies (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00025401.jpg","Raphael","84.GG.919"

"1895","Jan van Scorel orchestrated a multitude of media to create the carefully composed pastoral landscape on the recto. First, he lightly sketched the scene in brown ink and then liberally applied reddish wash and touches of yellow wash. Finally, he strengthened the composition with pen lines, including the foreground's rough, dense hatching and the invigorating half-moon squiggles of the vegetation. Van Scorel's lively pen work, combined with the colored washes, enhances the spatial recession and lends the sheet its dynamism.The yellow wash also evokes the sun-drenched tones of the Italian countryside. Van Scorel was the first northern Netherlandish artist to absorb the influence of Italian High Renaissance art in its native country. In Italy he learned the elements of Italian Renaissance approach to landscape painting, an idealized vision of Roman antiquity where shepherds tended flocks in serene, hilly terrain. This drawing is a type of imaginary scene known as a pastoral-- pastor  meaning  herdsman -- landscape.On the verso, a pyramid and other classical ruins are sketched in light brown ink; two muscular, draped male figures, perhaps river gods, are drawn in darker brown ink below.","10 7 16 x 13 5 16 in.","Platinum print","Italian","On the Conemaugh near New Florence, Pennsylvania","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13465101.jpg","William Herman Rau","85.XM.12.14"
"1895","Using pen and brown ink, Sinibaldo Scorza created a powerful drawing by combining studies of two animals of strongly contrasting temperament--an uneasy, sinister-looking wolf and two doves roosting peacefully nearby. Forceful strokes of the pen delineate the rough texture of the wolf's shaggy coat, its alert stance, and panting expression. The thicker lines around its tail and belly suggest the softer furry tufts. Scorza probably drew the animals from life, closely observing their positions and expressions. Scorza drew at least four versions of this wolf, both with and without the doves. Both strong draftsmanship and a direct, unsentimental attitude distinguish this drawing. The clarity of the lines and simple, linear forms suggest that the drawing could easily have been engraved, but scholars have not discovered such an engraving. European courtly collectors of the 1600s commissioned many such pictures of animal subjects.","23 9 16 in.","Albumen print","French","Coal Piers at North Fair Haven, L.V.R.R.","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04398401.jpg","William H.

Very pleased, the pope ordered another version for his collection, this one to be painted on stone. Sebastiano had begun painting on stone around 1530 and had come to favor it for some important commissions because stone lasted longer than canvas or wood.

"1856","Though Georges Seurat created many portraits of his mother, none have the arresting sense of calm and simplicity seen in this drawing. Here, he filled almost the entire sheet with Madame Seurat's face. Her downcast eyes create an aura of modesty, and suggest that she is involved in a quiet activity such as reading or embroidery. She is plain, though not severe, with pulled back bun and slightly thick features--an unassuming motherly personage, apparently unaware that she is being observed. The drawing possesses an almost mystical aura, combining extreme intimacy and proximity with the equally extreme interiority of the sitter's facial expression. Her puzzling physical presence and psychological stillness is made all the more vaporous and ghostly by the drawing technique Seurat called  irradiation,  which avoided distinct lines and represented the subtleties of light and shadow through tones of black crayon.The drawing was surely full of meaning for mother and son. Even after Georges Seurat moved to his own quarters in 1880, he dined with his mother almost every night. Their close relationship and frequent contact meant that he did not need to look far for a subject with whom he was intimately acquainted. Seurat gave this drawing to his mother.","8 7 16 x 13 1 8 in.","Albumen print","Dutch","A Burial Party, Cold Harbor, Virginia","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06464901.jpg","Henri-Victor Regnault","83.GA.264"

Several more poplars stand at the right, more shadowy still. Clearly visible through the Cont crayon rubbing, the watermarkMICHALLETemphasizes the paper's surface. This nearly abstract drawing, with its complete lack of edges among the forms, is a study in the pure interaction of light and shadow.When Seurat returned to Paris in 1880, he spent two years drawing in only black and white. This choice allowed him to explore the phenomenon of light's interpenetration and reflection. While absorbed in his preoccupation with gradation and contrast rather than line, he soon mastered the balance of massing light and dark. He developed a unique method of rubbing Cont crayon across highly textured paper, which gave him a variety of tones according to the degree of pressure he applied.","4 13 16 x 6 1 4 in.","Carbon print","Dutch","Svres, The Seine at Meudon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07129001.jpg","Oscar Gustave Rejlander","40 1 2 x 34 3 4 in."

The veil of her brimmed hat conceals her face, but her slender figure and erect posture convey that she is a refined young woman--an impression sustained by the fashionable fur-trimmed coat that envelops her.Georges Seurat drew this elegant profile as a series of geometric volumes animated by the play of light and shade. Rather than drawing individual lines, he rubbed roughly textured paper with greasy Cont crayon, creating a large shadowy mass. By combining various densities of crayon--darker for the figure, light and feathery for the background--Seurat explored a concept he called  irradiation.  According to his theory, light and dark tones mutually enhance each other as they come together. The glowing halo surrounding the poised figure exemplifies this theory.","10 x 13 1 8 in.","Albumen print","Dutch","Infant Photography Gives the Painter an Additional Brush","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04627601.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","86.GA.675"

"1637","The Svres porcelain manufactory first produced the design for this pair of cups and saucers in 1752. The design was named after Pierre Calabre, one of the shareholders of the Vincennes porcelain manufactory that preceded Svres. The bold decoration of green panels with a deep pink ground was a popular fashion for only two years, from 1759 to 1761.A hostess usually served tea in the cup; the guest then poured it into the deep saucer to cool and used the saucer as a drinking dish.","9 3 4 x 7 1 4 in.","Oil on panel","Dutch","The Abduction of Europa","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00106901.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","95.GA.18"
"1639","Designed to hold two candles each, this pair of vases would have formed part of a garniture of similarly decorated vessels. The decoration on these vessels--pink and green ground colors and scenes based on seventeenth-century paintings--typifies theRococostyle used at the Svresporcelainmanufactory around 1760.

"1640","This boat-shaped vase is one of the most famous models introduced by the Svresporcelainmanufactory; such discerning patrons asMadame de Pompadourand her brother themarquis de Marignycollected the form. Among the largest vessels produced by the factory, these vases were extremely difficult to fire; the multiple piercings in the body weakened the overall structure, and they tended to collapse in the kiln. Consequently, only about twelve were ever produced, ten of which survive today.The shape derives from thenef, a table decoration in the form of a ship, usually of precious metals, used since medieval times. This vase would have held potpourri used to perfume a room. Eighteenth-century ladies made their own, experimenting with various ingredients and sometimes blending essences for as long as nine years. Vases known asvaisseau  mat(masted ships) were made to be sold with other vases of different shapes to form a garniture. Claude-Nicolas Dodin painted the rustic scene on the front, copying an engraving after a painting by the Flemish artist David Teniers the Younger.","9 9 16 x 7 5 8 in.","Red chalk heightened with whitebodycolor","Dutch","Nude Woman with a Snake","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00000201.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","83.GG.199"
"1650","The complex construction and decoration of this pair of vases reveal the level of skill achieved by the craftsmen employed at the Svres porcelain manufactory. Each vase is divided into three sections: a base with holes for flowering bulbs, a tall body with pierced shoulders for potpourri, and a pierced lid. Painted ripples along the base and waves that project up the body, simulating cascades of water, give these vases their name ofpot pourri fontaine.Charles-Nicolas Dodin, who painted the Chinese figures on the sides, copied them from Chinesewoodcutsof about 1700.These vases once formed part of a garniture owned byMadame de Pompadour, mistress ofLouis XV. An inventory taken after her death in 1764 mentions that the garniture was displayed on the mantelpiece in her bedroom. The set was accompanied by matching porcelain wall lights, a pair of candelabra, and a potpourri vase(vaisseau  mat),both now in theMuse du Louvre.","7 5 8 x 9 5 16 in.","Pen and brown ink on light brown prepared paper; the figure of Joseph is on a separate, irregularly cut sheet","Dutch","Joseph in Prison Interpreting the Dreams of Pharoah's Baker and Butler","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00042401.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","7 1 8 x 9 11 16 in."

Factories generally sold the bowls singly, though they also came in pairs as part of a dinner or dessert service.The Svresporcelainmanufactory's stock books list several different designs for chestnut bowls. For bowls with pierced decoration, such as this pair, customers would have to pay nearly twice as much as for less intricate examples. It took all the skills of the kiln manager to prevent the sides from separating or sagging each time the piece was fired. He would have fired this pair three times, once for the porcelain body and the ground color, once for the enameled colors, and once for thegilding.","9 1 2 x 7 3 4 in.","Pen and brown ink, corrected with whitebodycolor","Dutch","Two Thatched Cottages with Figures at a Window","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00011501.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","85.GA.94"
"1650","This small covered cup with its deep saucer was designed to serve warm milk at breakfast. A military trophy decorates the center of the saucer, while specific battle scenes fill the reserves. The depicted battles took place between Prussia and Saxony in 1756 and 1757, at the beginning of the Seven Years' War. Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Saxony in August 1756, occupying the capital of Dresden. French troops were never deployed in this part of Europe, so the decoration could have been of little interest to a French buyer. As only one other similar example (ancuelle) survives, scholars assume that a German client, wishing to commemorate either the taking of Dresden by the Prussians or its recapture by the Saxons, specifically commissioned this cup and saucer and thecuelle.","9 7 16 x 7 9 16 in.","Pen and brown ink, brownwash, corrected with whitebodycolor","Dutch","Christ and the Canaanite Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00002301.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","85.GA.95"

The manufactory named the form, described in the Svres archives as aplateau de Courteille ou de chiffonire,after the marquis de Courteille, one ofLouis XV'sfinanciers, who represented the king's interest at Svres from 1751.The Svres artist Charles-Nicolas Dodin copied the scene from a painting by Franois Boucher onto the plaque. The original painting was set into wood paneling above a door in an important Parisian townhouse, the Htel de Soubise. It became one of Boucher's most popular scenes in the 1700s, known through many prints that circulated widely throughout Europe.","9 1 2 x 7 11 16 in.","Pen and brown ink","Dutch","The Mocking of Christ","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00004501.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","83.GA.363"

In addition to thecuvette Mahon,this French victory spawned other objects named after the town, including asauce  la Mahonnaise,now known as mayonnaise.The blue and gold decoration in three different patterns--trellis,pointill,andvermicul--over a pink ground is an unusual combination, very rarely seen on Svresporcelain.

"1654 - 1656","A sick or elderly person with an unsteady hand could have comfortably used this cup with its recessed saucer. The deep well kept the drink in the cup from being easily knocked over and spilled. One of few examples of Svres porcelain with a pink ground overlaid with dark blue, the cup has unusual swirling patterns that enliven the ground, while bunches of fruit and flowers fill the white reserves.Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, purchased all the cups with recessed saucers listed in the Svres porcelain manufactory's sales records between 1759 and 1764. This cup and saucer therefore probably came from her collection. She paid between sixty and seventylivresfor each cup--the equivalent of a month's wages for an experienced porcelain painter.","7 3 8 x 9 7 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and brownwashon paper toned with brown wash, intentionally scratched by the artist","French","A Wooded Road","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00011701.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","71.PA.15"

"1630 - 1631","Travelers to the Far East and the New World brought back three new hot drinks to Europe during the 1600s: tea, coffee, and chocolate. By the middle of the 1700s, these drinks had become part of the daily life of the aristocracy and wealthy bourgeoisie, requiring new serving vessels from which to pour them. Chocolate was considered a breakfast drink, tea was drunk in the afternoon, and coffee was taken after dinner.Porcelain was the favorite material for tea, coffee, and chocolate services, as it did not crack with heat and remained fairly cool to the touch, unlike silver vessels. This tea service, consisting of two cups and saucers, a covered sugar bowl, teapot, and tray, displaysRococoshapes and Neoclassical-style painted decoration. The pierced and lobed tray, with ribbons entwined around the handles and latticework panels, is typically Rococo; in contrast, the use of neat, symmetrical arrangements of floral garlands and arabesques is aNeoclassicaltrait.","4 3 4 x 3 5 8 in.","Pen and brown ink and brownwash, heightened with whitebodycolor, on Japanese paper","German","Shah Jahan and Dara Shikoh","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00011401.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","95.PB.15"

Porcelain painters in France in the 1700s were particularly fond of copyinggenrescenes from the previous century to decorate their vessels.Not only the painted scenes but also the gilding on this vase are typical of the grandest works produced at Svres. The gilding is of outstanding quality, thickly applied and then carefully tooled to create varied borders and patterns with subtle textures. Laurel leaf branches with berries and veined leaves and a wide band with zigzag lines frame the reserve panels. The gilded surfaces of the handles, the laurel swags, and the gadroons above the foot areburnishedin imitation of gilt bronze.","1 ft. 11 5 8 in. x 1 ft. 9 5 8 in. x 11 13 16 in.","Oil on panel","Italian","An Old Man in Military Costume","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00078701.jpg","Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn","72.DA.47"

The Svres porcelain manufactory sold these vases for the high sum of three hundred and sixtylivres--an amount equivalent to six months' salary for a porcelain painter.Svres artisans made the vases from  true,  hard-paste porcelain, instead of the traditional soft-paste. The hard-paste porcelain recipe was still new, and the craftsmen were still experimenting with different types of decoration when these pieces were produced in 1778. Instead of glazing the vases with ground color and then gilding them, porcelain gilders first applied the gold onto the white body of the vases. Porcelain painters then added enamel colors within the gold outlines. Decorators also experimented with the use of silver on thetrellisworkas seen on these vases, but they soon abandoned this practice since the silver tarnished over time.","12 7 8 x 9 3 4 in.","Oil on canvas","Spanish","Joseph and Potiphar's Wife","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00105101.jpg","Guido Reni","89.PA.41"

"1908","These lidded bowls were intended to hold potpourri, the smell of which passed through the pierced collar. Containers for potpourri first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon produced in large numbers from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer. To create potpourri, fashionable women experimented with dried petals and spices to achieve the finest fragrances, some of which were left to mature for up to nine years. Perfumes and potpourri were used liberally to disguise malodorous air, as indoor plumbing was nonexistent and frequent bathing was considered unhealthy.By means of a drawing in the archives of the Svres porcelain manufactory of a similar, but unmounted bowl, scholars have identified the craftsman who made the twisted and coiledgiltbronzemountson this piece. The drawing, dated 1784, has an inscription noting that it was to be mounted by  Tomier,  Pierre-Philippe Thomire, one of the most celebrated bronze casters of the late 1700s.

With their fanciful chinoiserie scenes of gold and platinum pagodas on a black ground, the wine coolers imitate Chineselacquerwork. In the 1790s, elaborate vessels such as these were mainly purchased by wealthy clients outside of France, since theFrench Revolutionseverely reduced the number ofpatronsable to afford such luxurious objects.Scholars consider the rich decoration in gold and platinum on these wine coolers to be both rare and interesting. Only in the 1780s did porcelain makers at the Svres manufactory succeed in producing this deep blue-black ground by mixing oxides of iron, cobalt, andmanganese. In the 1770s and 1780s, the potters had experimented with silver decoration but found that it tarnished with time. Platinum thus became a more popular alternative in the 1790s, and craftsmen used it mainly to decorate objects with black or brown grounds. Artists also applied two colors of gold to these coolers--a yellowish and a more orangish shade--and further varied them by burnishing some areas and leaving others matte.","9 3 4 x 7 9 16 in.","Platinum print","Italian","The Letter","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06063101.jpg","Francisco Ribalta","91.GA.56"

Rough-hewn, wooden planks marking the entrance to the stall produce the effect of a picture within a picture, much like a frame around a painting.An overwhelming sense of abandonment permeates the scene. How many years has this buggy remained unused in its stall  In many ways, this photograph documents a disappearing way of life. At the time this image was made, gas and steam-powered vehicles began to replace horse-drawn carriages on America's roadways.Domestic and utilitarian objects fascinated Charles Sheeler.

Further, while from afar the sculpture's bronze patina appears smooth, it is in fact pocked and striated, more akin to the skin of a scaly reptile than a human.Peter Shelton often titles his work with letters that run together without spaces or upper case distinctions. This technique encourages the viewer to consider words and letters in new ways. The title of this sculpture suggests that it represents an outer garment or covering for a figure rather than a figure itself. The bronze's hollow form supports such a reading. But the work's figural appearance and scale equally encourages the viewer to consider how his or her own proportions, position, and weight relate to the dark, ghostly form before them.","4 5 8 x 5 15 16 in.","Pen and brown ink with brownwashover black chalk","Italian","Landscape with Travelers, Two Riding in a Carriage Driven by a Postilion and a Third on Horseback Behind","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00050001.jpg","Marco Ricci","78.PA.230"

Some of the houses had fallen into disrepair, others had been renovated and now, a hundred years later, the renovations themselves looked old. The growth, again, and alteration that had taken place in this apparent changeless scene were astonishing.Thus Stephen Shore described the transformation he encountered when he was commissioned by the J.

Early collodion-on-glass negatives, such as those Silvy used to render this scene, were particularly sensitive to blue light, making them unsuitable for simultaneously capturing definition in land and sky. Silvy achieved this combination of richly defined clouds and terrain by skillfully wedding two exposures and disguising any evidence of his intervention with delicate drawing and brushwork on the combination negative. The print exemplifies the tension between reality and artifice that is an integral part of the art of photography.The Huisne River provided power for flour and tanning mills and was significant in the history of Nogent-le-Rotrou, the town where Silvy was born. This photograph was taken from the Pont de Bois, a bridge over the river, looking toward the south and downstream. It was only a few minutes' walk from Silvy's birthplace. As the reviewer suggested, it is a sentimental image, an idyllic landscape full of reverence for and memory of a timeless place that was significant in the artist's development.","4 5 8 x 5 13 16 in.","Oil on canvas","British","Diana and Her Dog","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00078001.jpg","Sebastiano Ricci","72.PA.29"

The sitter is gracefully posed with her head turned in profile and her hands delicately displaying her bejeweled fingers. She is wrapped in a beaded velvet shawl with a large cameo at her throat and a beaded hair ornament--finery that reflects her aristocratic status.Silvy was well known among the fashionable English aristocracy and accordingly stocked his studio with stylish accessories and props that created a suitable image of wealth and social standing. He was thought to possess superior artistic taste, which directed his skillful handling of models and settings.","Diam.:  29 3 4 in.","Pen and brown ink, brownwash, and black chalk","French","The Death of Seneca (recto); Study of a Man (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00039101.jpg","Sebastiano Ricci","70.PA.33"
"1725 - 1730","I have brought to my picture-making, qualities of expression that came out of my experience of music and literature. My belief in the meaning of abstract expression came from my love of music. And my use of metaphor comes out of my experience of poetry and literature.Made in the abandoned mining town of Jerome, Arizona, this photograph of cracked and peeling paint by Aaron Siskind has an almost musical rhythm that echoes the influences he discussed in the statement above. In Siskind's close-up view, the paint is transformed from the reality of decay into abstracted, multi-layered textures and tones formed by shadow and reflection. Seen in more selective detail than the eye registers at a glance, the paint becomes a metaphor of the passage of time and the impermanence of place.","9 7 16 x 11 in.","Oil on canvas","German","Perseus Confronting Phineus with the Head of Medusa","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00091401.jpg","Sebastiano Ricci","2003.5"

Rather than simply representing the specifics of a location, Alfred Sisley painted the glorious golden light of a summer's day, flickering in the trees and the long grasses. He painted thisplein-airlandscape study somewhere near the road on the way fromVersaillesto Saint-Germain. The painting's broken strokes of brilliant color and the impressionistic brushstrokes that serve as figures would have defined it as a rough sketch, but Sisley judged it complete and presented it as a beautiful finished work.","8 x 10 3 4 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Triumph of the Marine Venus","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00070501.jpg","Marco Ricci","85.GB.210"
"1730 - 1735","This man holds the pink very conspicuously, yet its significance in the portrait remains mysterious. The flower was originally named for its bloom shape and time of flowering, at the end of May, aroundPentecost, known in the Netherlands as  Pinkster.  Presumably, the petals' serrated edges were seen as resembling the tongues of flame that descended on Mary and the Apostles at Pentecost, enabling them to speak in any language, spread God's word, and build the Church. Additionally,  pinksten  meant  fiftieth  in German, and Pentecost was celebrated fifty days afterEaster.The portrait has been greatly damaged, but the face and the flower display Michael Sittow's sensitivity to the effects of texture and light. To create his characteristically luminous surfaces, Sittow applied many layers of translucent paint. The sitter's projection of melancholy also typifies Sittow's portraits.","H:  26 3 4 x W:  13 1 2 x D:  13 1 4 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Landscape with Classical Ruins and Figures","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00060301.jpg","Riccio","71.DA.104"

Two compositional studies on the verso display Skrta's sensitivity to the ability of a few well-chosen lines to describe everything. At the left, his economical, delicate lines suggest drapery, relationships, and form. On the right, he made furtherreductionsby gently going over selected red chalk lines with pen and ink.

"1848","Backed snarling against a tree, a wild boar fends off the attacking hounds. The bodies of three dogs lie piled in a heap on the left, while others leap towards the boar. Frans Snyders concentrated particularly on the animals' tormented facial expressions, from the angry stare of the cornered boar to the suffering of the hound on its back to the growling fury of the dogs who attack their prey at the rear. Each is caught in suspended motion, leaping, rushing, and growling. Delicately executed pen and brown ink emphasize the boar's wiry coat, whilewashesreproduce the dogs' soft fur and the fine tufts of undergrowth at the back.Many aristocratic patrons in Flanders and throughout Europe in the 1600s favored monumental hunting scenes as a reminder of their passionate love for the chase. Snyders was particularly sought after for his still lifes of animals. He probably produced this drawing as a preparatory study for a later painting. So popular was this painting that at least six copies of it still survive.","8 x 10 3 4 in.","Black and white chalk on blue paper","Italian","Self-Portrait Wearing a Cloth Hat","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00012301.jpg","Jean-Henri Riesener","70.PA.1"

The scene takes place in an abundantly stocked pantry, where various kinds of dead fowl await preparation. The large table upon which the boy sits is laden with baskets, bowls, and platters that overflow with ripe fruit, including apples, peaches, and pomegranates. To complete this picture of domestic life, a cat stands in the window on the upper right, antagonizing two dogs below.Pantry scenes like this were derived from earlier paintings of town markets, which were appreciated for their display of nature's bounty. This painting is a collaborative work by Frans Snyders, who specialized in still lifes and animal subjects, and Jan Boeckhorst, who painted the figures.","6 9 16 x 8 1 8 in.","Oakveneeredwith ebony; set with panels of Japaneselacquer;giltbronze mounts; black marble top","Italian","Secrtaire","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00615801.jpg","Ernst Friedrich August Rietschel","86.GB.612"
"1710 - 1720","While Christ bends beneath a heavy cross, he still retains a serene air. In contrast, the soldier on the right glares back at him ferociously, seemingly determined to add to Christ's burden by pressing down on the cross. Sodoma focused on these facial expressions to emphasize the peace of God, even amidst suffering.Sodoma used a highly elaborate technique to draw this scene, with considerable white heightening to create painterly effects for both the faces and the garments of the figures. He drew the Resurrection on the verso in a more calm, classical manner with a more linear technique. Brush and brown ink delineate Christ's muscular body as he emerges from the edge of the tomb with one foot still inside. Cross-hatching and white heightening build up the folds of drapery that flow around him. Sodoma made this study in preparation for a 1535 fresco of theResurrectionin a public building in Siena.","15 1 8 x 10 5 16 in.","Marble","Italian","Bust of Felix Mendelssohn","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00134201.jpg","Hyacinthe Rigaud","88.PA.136"

Her hair blows behind her, indicating sudden movement. The sharp angles of her eyebrows and nose express anxiety, while the diagonal of her body expresses the repulsion she feels towards the growling beast.Andromeda and the Sea Monsterdepicts a dramatic moment from the ancient Greek author Euripides' tale of Andromeda and Perseus. Andromeda's mother angered the gods with her boast that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, the attendants of the god of the sea, Poseidon. To appease the offended Poseidon, who threatened to destroy their entire kingdom, Andromeda's parents sacrificed their daughter by leaving her where she would be devoured by his monster. As Andromeda awaits the monster, chained to a rock, Perseus flies overhead, falls instantly in love with her, and rescues her by slaying the beast. Massimiliano Soldani Benzi's interpretation of the story is unusual because he focused on Andromeda's horror at the monster instead of on her rescue.","7 9 16 x 10 1 2 in.","Oil on canvas","French","Charles de Saint-Albin, Archbishop of Cambrai","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00094001.jpg","Bartolomeo Rigossi","MS. 71, VERSO"
"1275","Andromeda & LedaEnamored of the beautiful Leda, the god Jupiter seduced her in the form of a swan. In this bronze version of the mythological scene, Leda and the swan are suggestively posed: the arc of the lovers' embracing arms and wings and the curvature of their bodies, poised before union, increases the erotic suspense. The swath of drapery trapped between Leda's thighs, as well as her movement drawing the swan down towards her, hint at the inevitable moment of union.This tale of seduction, mentioned inOvid'sMetamorphoses, was a popular subject for artists from theRenaissanceonwards. An unusual aspect of this version, however, is that Castor and Pollux, the fruit of the union, are not shown. Instead, the artist includedCupid, the god of love. Perched on his wings, Cupid encourages the amorous Jupiter.The contrasting textures of Leda's smooth voluptuous skin and the swan's feathers hint at Massimiliano Soldani Benzi's technical virtuosity with bronze casting.

Night looms behind but, as goddess of dawn, Aurora will soon dispel the darkness. Below, her aged husband Tithonus shields his eyes from his wife's brightness. After seducing Tithonus when he was young and beautiful, Aurora asked Zeus to grant him immortality, but she forgot to ask for eternal youth as well.

Why Francesco Solimena took or was given this subject is unknown, yet its inherent drama and potential for passion suited theBaroquetaste. Characteristically, Solimena heightened the moment's intensity by creating monumental figures on an already huge canvas and presenting only the essentials of a setting. According to his eighteenth-century biographer, Solimena painted this subject for a series of five canvases of historical and mythological subjects for the state attorney in Venice.","21 11 16 x 15 7 8 in.","Bronze and copper","French","Vase","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31788601.jpg","Bernard van Risenburgh","72.DA.44"

Four large, drooping flowers and two tiny masks, whose wavy hair and beards echo the scrolling vines, hang from the ends of several of the vines. In antiquity, leafy designs such as this one, known as rinceaux, were popular motifs for ornamenting a variety of forms from furniture to architecture. Such motifs copied from ancient Greek and Roman art fascinated designers in the 1500s.Although both sides of the drawing have been cut off, leaving only the edge of an urn on the right, Solis probably intended to show the beginning of the same repeating pattern. Other artists and craftsmen could then have copied this continuous decorative frieze to ornament a panel on a variety of objects.

His portrait is presented in full profile. Apollo's features are idealized, as was typical in art of the early Roman Empire: a square face with broad cheeks, a round chin, and a remarkably straight nose.Although this gem closely resembles other images of Apollo, scholars believe the artist, probably Solon, intended this as an idealized portrait not of the god, but of the Roman emperor Augustus. Roman emperors revered individual gods, and Augustus's patron god was Apollo. Augustus believed Apollo secured victory for his forces in the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C: Solon carved other images of Augustus and members of the Imperial family in the guise of deities.Look closely and you will notice that the image is carved into the gem--a technique known asintaglio--to create a sense of depth.

These were enormous areas, but still there were details. There's nothing happening in the sky and I decided, 'No skies for me.' Finally there was no foreground, there was no middle distance, there was nothing. And, there was very little distinction between the plants and the rocks. Even the rocks were struggling.Thus Frederick Sommer described his initial difficulties in photographing the barren Arizona landscape. Cacti rise up intermittently from the arid ground like ritual markers, as Sommer's unusualperspectiveand meticulous framing redefine this horizonless desert landscape, a terrain at once both ancient and contemporary.","2 3 16 x 2 11 16 in.","Oakveneeredwithamaranth, kingwood, mahogany, and tulipwood;giltbronzemounts","French","Pair of Cabinets","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00667901.jpg","Bernard van Risenburgh","2011.18.24"

The bones and fur stand out as lighter shades against the darkness of the soil beneath, brightening the otherwise dull terrain. Sommer's dynamic composition and framing brings the photograph to life. The coyote on the left side appears to be leaping out of the picture, while another one enters the image from below. In the center, one coyote lies in a suckling position under another. The legs of all the coyotes seem to be captured in mid-motion, adding a sense of action to the image.Sommer used a large-format camera to capture this degree of detail.

A dark horizontal beam cuts across the upper third of the photograph, slicing a recessed path across Ernst's eyes that gives the illusion of a mask. Rather than a straight likeness, this is a psychological portrait, though the viewer must contemplate whether it is an exploration of the subject or the photographer, Frederick Sommer.

"1765","Starting in the 1960s, Frederick Sommer produced a series of paper  sculptures  that he then photographed. He cut sheets of butcher-block paper using a razor blade, transforming them into abstract patterns. But these incisions were anything but random; his creations were often inspired by images he found in the hundreds of books he kept on shelves in his workshop. Hanging his paper creations from clips a few feet in front of a wall, he carefully lit them--the shapes, light, and shadow providing a sense of depth and kinetic energy.The inspiration for this piece is the legend of the Three Graces, fertility goddesses from Greek mythology. Light penetrates the slits, suggesting three bodies dancing together. Thecompositionis less about extremes of light and dark, and more about midtones--the subtle differences in grays contained in the spectrum between white and black.","6 1 8 x 5 7 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Italian","A Hermit Praying in the Ruins of a Roman Temple","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00091801.jpg","Hubert Robert","83.GG.37"

"1806","The play of light on the water and against the sun-drenched walls of the Alhambra, one of Spain's most influential architectural achievements, was ideally suited to Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida's artistic mission: exploring the changing effects of light under the broadest possible range of conditions. Just as the Alhambra's architects had interwoven light and shade, stone and water, Sorolla captured the myriad patterns created by the architecture, water, and light together. The shadows of the thin columns against the walls create a pattern reflected in the water, whose liquidity is remarkable, given the thick gestural paint that Sorolla applied.The thirty-five-acre Alhambra, built between 1238 and 1358, was the last Moslem stronghold in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages. The Moorish architectural style reached its ultimate refinement here, an airy fantasy that almost seems to float, despite its solid construction of stone and stucco.","11 3 8 x 10 1 4 in.","Red chalk","French","A Draftsman in the Capitoline Gallery","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30515001.jpg","Hubert Robert","84.XM.898"

He preferred to paint even portraits outdoors, trying to achieve a spontaneous effect.  [N]o matter how much labor you may have expended on the canvas, the result should look as if it had all been done with ease and at a sitting,  he said in 1909.","18 3 4 x 19 3 4 in.","Pen and brown ink, brown and bluewashes, over black chalk","German","Landscape with Ruins","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00001601.jpg","Hubert Robert","77.PA.127"
"1698","This is one of a series of four paintings of townscapes and garden scenes in Seville that Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida painted in 1910. Two years earlier, he had made a similar series of views in the same city. While he retained the brilliance and atmosphere of his 1908 Seville paintings, he seems to have approached this second series in a more traditional manner.The courtyard of Seville's Alczar Palace, the city's most splendid example of Moorish architecture,  sparkles in the dappled summer sunlight. As always, Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida was concerned with color and light, brilliance and atmosphere. The colored reflections of the light animate the scene and help to define the forms, creating a sense that nature is ever-changing.Sorolla originally chose this frame, made by the firm of Jos Cano, which still exists in Madrid, for the picture. Photographs show the same type ofgiltframe hanging in Sorolla's studio and house during his lifetime.","17 13 16 x 21 1 16 in.","Oil on canvas","German","Demolition of the Chteau of Meudon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 26530201.jpg","Henry Peach Robinson","72.DA.51"
"1787","In this view of the garden at Seville's Alczar Palace, Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida concentrated on the geometry of form and the clear, bright sunlight of southern Spain instead of the changing reflections of light. He had returned to Seville in 1910 to create a second series of paintings, four paintings of townscapes and garden scenes, following the series he had painted in 1908. While he retained the brilliance and atmosphere of his earlier paintings, he seems to have approached this second series in a less fanciful manner.J. Paul Getty had originally determined to collect art only in certain areas, but at the 1933 auction of the Thomas Fortune Ryan collection he bought ten Sorollas, one of his few spontaneous purchases. He later wrote of that moment:  I was struck by the remarkable quality of Sorolla's paintings, being especially fascinated by his unique treatment of sunlight. . . . Although the purchase of theseImpressionistworks was a major digression from my usual fivefold collecting path, my opinion regarding their beauty, appeal and artistic merit remains the same as it was when I first saw the canvases.

The dog looks lovingly up at his master, but the youth appears to be gazing elsewhere. Perhaps he is looking in the direction of another figure, because this sculpture was intended to be one of a pair.The sculpture's companion piece,Lady Feeding a Sheep with Hay, features a shepherdess leaning on a gate feeding a pet lamb. As was customary in porcelain figure production, the two are based on an engraving-Shepherd and Shepherdess by Angelica Kauffmann.Shepherd with His Dogmay also be inspired by a famous sixteenth-century Roman statue,Antinous, of a youthful-looking male in the same pose.This elegant fourteen-inch sculpture made of white biscuit porcelain was produced at the Derby Porcelain Factory in England. (Biscuit is a type of unglazed porcelain admired for its marble-like appearance.)Shepherd with His Dogis thought to have been modeled by the highly talented but little-known Swiss porcelain artist Johann Jakob Wilhelm Spngler. The sculpture was originally attributed to two of Spngler's contemporaries, but scholars now believe it to be Spngler's work due to its refined style, graceful lines, and crisp detail.","3 5 8 x 4 3 4 in.","Oakveneeredwith palisander, alder, rosewood, ivory, and mother-of-pearl","American","Reading and Writing Stand","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00674001.jpg","David Roentgen","82.DE.171"

The largest miniatures measure only about three inches on the longest side, but they are incredibly detailed, often with deep panoramic landscapes framed by lush borders.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and son of bibliophilePhilip the Good, saw many of his father's unfinished book commissions through to completion; this prayer book is one of the rare commissions Charles initiated himself. The accounts of the Burgundian dukes record payments in 1469 to the scribe Nicholas Spierinc of Ghent, to theilluminatorLieven van Lathem of Antwerp, and to the goldsmith who made the original clasps for the binding of this costly book. Along with Lathem, several anonymous illuminators collaborated on this project, including the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy. In the 1480s, a series of additional prayers with miniatures by a French illuminator was added to the volume.","8 5 8 x 7 3 4 in.","Oak, fir, and Scots pine,veneeredwith mahogany and maple burl;giltbronze mounts; steel fittings","American","Rolltop Desk","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00618701.jpg","David Roentgen","2002.2"

The steeply pitched roofs and towers of the picturesque city appeared often in Stevens' work; though not definitively identified, they resemble those of Prague.Characteristically, Stevens enlivened this scene with reddishwashhighlights in the trees and blue wash in the sky. His flexible pen strokes and broad areas of wash lend the view an atmospheric quality.","7 1 4 x 5 1 2 in.","Gilt bronze, enameled metal","American","Clock on Bracket","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00616301.jpg","Cristoforo Roncalli","78.PA.231"
"1846","From 1893 to 1895 I often walked the streets of New York downtown, near the East River, taking my hand camera with me. . . . [One day] I found myself in front of the old Post Office. . . . It was extremely cold. Snow lay on the ground. A driver in a rubber coat was watering his steaming car horses.Though many of Alfred Stieglitz's early photographs relied heavily upon atmosphere to mute the harshness of urban life, he romanticized nothing in this image. At the southern end of the Harlem streetcar line that traveled up and down Fifth Avenue, he simply captured a streetcar driver watering his horses in front of the old Post Office.At the time, Stieglitz had just returned from Germany and found America culturally barren in comparison. According to one anecdote, when he saw the horses being nourished by their driver, he decided that he should assume the same role and nourish the arts in this country. Within a few years, Stieglitz was organizing pioneering exhibitions of painting, photography, and sculpture in his modest galleries.","16 9 16 x 21 1 4 in.","Red and black chalk on blue paper","American","An Angel Holding a Book (recto); Three Studies of a Falling Male Figure (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14355701.jpg","Phillip Roos","83.GB.197"

The steaming horses being watered on a cold winter day, the snow-covered streets...[expressed]my own sense of loneliness in my own country.Recently returned from nearly a decade in Europe, Stieglitz found not only his subject matter on the streets of New York but also an emotional relationship with the city's anonymity and alienation. This photograph, with its physically tight spaces and faceless inhabitants, expressed Stieglitz's mood in somber tones.","48 3 8 x 30 3 8 in.","Pen and brown ink with gray wash over red chalk","American","Descent from the Cross","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10867001.jpg","Marcus Aurelius Root","98.XM.163.2"

I stood spellbound for a while. I saw shapes related to one another--a picture of shapes, and underlying it, a new vision that held me...Twenty-five years after making this photograph, Alfred Stieglitz recalled the moment in vivid detail, no doubt aided by the information provided within the frame. He had wandered down from the first-class deck to survey the jumbled scene of teeming passengers in the steerage, or economy class, section, which contrasted sharply with  the mob called the 'rich'  that he had left behind.

Stieglitz made this expressive study of O'Keeffee's nearly dancing hands and her torso, dressed in a crisp black dress with a sheer, voile shawl collar, reminiscent of the one she wore when they first met at his gallery.

From the very beginning of their relationship, Stieglitz photographed O'Keeffe, eventually produced a cumulative portrait of more than 325 photographs.Here photographed so that only her hands are visible, the dynamism of her gesture evokes the rhythms of music and dance as well as the abstract, biomorphic shapes of O'Keeffe's own drawings and paintings.","5 ft. 8 1 2 in. x 8 ft. 8 1 4 in. x 6 ft. 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","Armenian","Boy on Roof, Pitt Street, New York","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13375201.jpg","T oros Roslin","MS. 59, FOL. 3V"

In the fall of 1922, Stieglitz and his siblings inherited the family property on Lake George, near the Adirondacks. The relaxed atmosphere of the retreat led to the creation of some of Stieglitz's most informal photographs.

His bold, fractured hatching lends a powerful sculptural quality to the hands. In the face, his strong linework, working together with the luminosity of the white of the paper, produces a powerful, forthright expression.

"1937","This aged and emaciated figure is the blind general Belisarius. Heavy eyelids almost completely cover his eyes, which register nothing of the outside world. Deeply set eye sockets, encircled by wrinkles, also draw attention to Belisarius's blindness. His veined and wrinkled forehead, tilted head, and open mouth, emphasize his vulnerable state.In the mid-1700s, a novel by Jean-Franois Marmontel revived interest in Belisarius--a popular general of theRoman Empirewhose promising career was sabotaged by the jealous Emperor Justinian I. In Marmontel's novel, the emperor has the heroic general blinded, reducing Belisarius to begging. He is eventually rediscovered and aided by former officers and his family. This dramatic tale of patriotism, injustice, and redemption was widely embraced in revolutionary and post-revolutionary France and was a popular subject for painters and sculptors--including Jacques-Louis David, Jean-Antoine Houdon, and Franois Grard (whose paintingBelisariusis also in the Museum's collection).Jean-Baptiste Stouf exhibited this marble sculpture at theSalonof 1791; he had previously shown aterracottamodel of thebustof Belisarius in 1785. Like many eighteenth-century artists who depicted Belisarius, Stouf emphasized the subject's pathos, highlighting the injustice of the general's plight. The intimate and sympathetic portrait also demonstrates Stouf's mastery of marble carving. The luxuriantly sculpted beard and cascading curls of hair, the crumpled, crinkled skin, and the broad, high brow are all captured with a subtlety that belies the challenge of carving stone. The formal characteristics of Belisarius echoclassicalandBaroquesculpture but also anticipate theRomanticsensibility of the 1800s.","7 11 16 x 11 7 8 in.","Pen and brown ink with light brown and graywashon ivory paper","French","Portrait of Elizabeth Siddal Resting, Holding a Parasol","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00049801.jpg","Rosso Fiorentino","97.GA.67"
"1892","In this idyllic scene of fishermen working on the Arno River in Florence at low tide, Stradanus carefully depicted important Florentine monuments such as the Campanile, the Florence Cathedral, and the Palazzo Vecchio. The realistic setting reveals his Netherlandish roots in the close attention to naturalistic and topographical details. The crowded composition and exaggerated, often twisting, movements of the figures reveal the Mannerist influence of Stradanus's years in Florence.Stradanus changed his mind about the compositional details and replaced the lower center of the drawing, inserting more fishermen and a reclining river god in the center foreground. With an urn and a horn of plenty, the river god serves as a personification of the Arno, the river that bisects Florence.Stradanus probably made this sheet as part of a series of hunting and fishing scenes commissioned by Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici. The designs, most of which were later engraved, were intended for tapestries to decorate the Medici villa at Poggio a Caiano, but only a few tapestries were ever woven. Artisans later copied this scene in a stucco relief in the courtyard of another Florentine palace.","4 7 16 to 4 9 16 x 7 11 16 in.","Red chalk with some traces of black chalk","French","Study of a Male Figure","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00003001.jpg","Arthur Rothstein","2002.3"

In the foreground, spindly, leafless trees line up against massive apartment buildings. The same year this photograph was made, Strand exhibited his work at 291, a gallery operated by Alfred Stieglitz. An influential pioneer in the effort to elevate photography to the status of art, Stieglitz described Strand's work as  brutally direct, devoid of all flim-flam, devoid of trickery and of any  'ism.'   These photographs,  he stated,  are the direct expression of today. Strand made this photograph shortly after becoming acquainted with Stieglitz and the Photo-Secessionist movement. The clarity of this image illustrates how deeply Stieglitz influenced Strand. Prior to their meeting, Strand's work was in the soft-focus style of Pictorialism.","25 5 8 x 19 3 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","French","Gee's Bend, Alabama (Artelia Bendolph)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04829401.jpg","Henri Rousseau","2007.13"

This still life configuration of dishes and fruit becomes a formal composition of arcs and curves. The objects transcend their everyday function to become lines and shapes defined by the dramatic lighting.","12 3 16 x 7 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","English","A Centennial of Independence","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00093701.jpg","Thodore Rousseau","98.DH.149"

At the time, most photographers were choosing  pretty  subjects and creating fanciful atmospheric effects in the style of theImpressionists. Paul Strand's unconventional subject and direct approach challenged assumptions about the medium.At once depicting misery and endurance, struggle and degradation, Strand's portrait of a blind woman sets up a complex confrontation.  The whole concept of blindness,  as one historian has noted,  is aimed like a weapon at those whose privilege of sight permits them to experience the picture. . . .

Each wall face is a different shade of gray, determined by the intense and even light that falls on the building from the right. The dramatic, stormy-looking sky barely visible along the top portends future trouble for this serene scene.

At the far end of the main building, a bell tower stands, surmounted by a cross. A mysterious block, perhaps a chapel, juts out from the main building, unrelieved by doors or windows.

In this photograph, Strand explored the interplay of light and geometry in a village outside Mexico City.

The empty, seemingly abandoned town square appears both secretive and timeless.

"1613 - 1614","Recognized many appealing qualities in Mexico's indigenous people, Paul Strand stated that he liked  to photograph people who have strength and dignity in their faces; whatever life has done to them, it hasn't destroyed them.  With her feet tucked under her, the woman in this photograph sits on the ground, waiting for customers to purchase the carefully laid-out produce. beside her. By isolating and closely framing the subject, Strand endow her with a sculptural quality.Strand had shown interest in American native populations as early as 1922, when he applied for government funds to make educational films at Indian reservations in the Southwest. That project was not approved, however. It wasn't until his trip to Mexico, ten years later, that Strand was able to work with a somewhat insular population like the one in the Patzcuaro town of Michoacan. There, Mexican government sponsorship allowed him access to indigenous people, who were typically reticent with outsiders.","4 1 2 x 3 3 8 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish","The Entombment","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00104701.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","71.PA.14"
"1615 - 1617","Paul Strand arrived in Mexico in late 1932, abandoning his  usual working methods at the border.  No longer subscribing to the popular precept that  you can't make a portrait unless you know that person,  Strand began making photographs of Mexico's native population. In this expressive image, a man in tattered clothing rests his head against a crumbling wall, with his eyes closed and his arm partially hiding his face. The burden of generations of labor and sorrow appears to overwhelm him. Without knowing the man personally, Strand managed to capture an iconic subject, whose dignity and vulnerability combined to reveal the hardship of village life.","4 1 2 x 3 3 8 in.","Pen and brown ink, brown wash over black chalk, incised for transfer","Flemish","The Assumption of the Virgin","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00002201.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","83.GB.384"

The darkened walls of nearby structures draw the eye toward the open space in thebackground, providing an almost telescopic effect.

"1617","New England has . . . a special meaning for Americans. The land and its people, their cities and towns, their factories and mills, the villages surrounded by farms, the long coast and the sea whipping against it . . . . But there is something more. . . . For here in this region . . . were born many of the thoughts and actions that have shaped America for more than three hundred years.So wrote Paul Strand in the foreword toTime in New England, a book that combined his photographs of the region with texts by New Englanders. Strand was encouraged to undertake this project in 1945 by Nancy Newhall, then acting curator of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. He spent a number of years looking for  images of nature and architecture and faces of people that were either part of or related in feeling to [New England's] great tradition. This striking composition--an open doorway and an assortment of everyday objects on a porch--was accompanied by the writings of Henry Adams. Describing life in the country, Adams wrote of  the smell of hot pine-woods and sweet fern in the scorching summer noons; of new-mown hay; of ploughed earth; . . . of stables, barns, [and] cow-yards.  The rich surface details in this image convey the sensuousness that Strand associated with New England's scenery.","21 1 8 x 30 1 8 in.","Red, black, blue, green, and yellow chalk with touches of pen and brown ink on pale gray paper","Flemish","A Man Threshing Beside a Wagon, Farm Buildings Behind","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00009801.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","73.PA.68"
"1617 - 1620","In the early 1950s Paul Strand spent six weeks in the rural northern Italian town of Luzzara, located on the Po River. He traveled the countryside with local townsman Valentino Lusetti, whose family Strand photographed arranged across the front of their family home. This group portrait includes Valentino's widowed mother Anna, standing with a solemn expression in the darkened doorway, and four of his brothers: Bruno, Guerrino, Afro, and Nino, none of whom look directly at the camera.The circle and spokes of the bicycle wheel are repeated in the semi-circular paned window above the door and in the half-circle shape seen through the door above Anna's left shoulder, serving as a unifying element of the composition. In 1955 Strand published a book of photographs he made in Luzzara,Un paese(A Village).","11 1 4 x 17 5 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish","Diana and Her Nymphs on the Hunt","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00063101.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","85.PB.146"

She holds a tightly woven, straw hat in front of her, its crown slightly dented. The wide-brimmed hat hides her young working hands, while the wintry bare branches carefully outline her rigid form. In Paul Strand's precise vision, the thicker branch on the right aligns perfectly with the outline of a window at the upper right, a subtle detail that reinforces the elegant geometry of the composition.","36 1 8 x 48 1 4 in.","Black chalk with touches of red chalk in the face","Flemish","Man in Korean Costume","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00005801.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","98.GG.14"

At the time the image was made, the horse was replaced by modern machinery and literally put out to pasture--a scene that was repeated all over the British Isles. Provincial existence on the windswept islands was equally threatened during this time as English usurped the traditional Gaelic as the dominant language, and much of the population moved to the mainland.","Framed [with original engaged frame]: 21 x 16 1 2 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish","David Meeting Abigail","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00070901.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","82.GB.140"

The four oval cartouches on the rim represent important events related to Antony: at the top, Antony meetsOctavianand Lepidus on an island in the river Lavinus to form the Triumvirate; on the left, Antony first sees Cleopatra when she arrives on an impressive barge on the river Cydnus; on the bottom, a banquet; and on the right, Antony kills himself.Although the basin's design derives from a sketch by Genoese artist Bernardo Strozzi, the highreliefof the figures, some of whom are modeled almost in the round, theManneristturbulence of the battle scene, and the use of depth andperspectiveindicate the work of a northern European artist, perhaps one fromFlanders. The detail and delicacy of the silverwork of this basin suggest that it was ceremonial rather than functional; it was probably exhibited on a buffet on the most festive occasions.","7 15 16 x 6 3 16 in.","Oil on panel","Flemish","The Virgin as the Woman of the Apocalypse","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00088101.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","87.PB.15"

When theTrojanprince Paris abductedHelen, the beautiful wife ofMenelaus, king ofSparta, and carried her off to the city of Troy, the Greeks responded by mounting an attack on the city, thus beginning theTrojan War. Both the bronze's subject--the Trojan War--and its small-scale format reveal the artist's interest inclassicalculture. The handling of the figures, however, shows the influence of ItalianManneristsculpture of the 1600s. The sculptor, Giovanni Francesco Susini, welded the three nude figures together in an intensely dramaticcomposition. While Paris attempts to carry Helen off, she valiantly struggles against him. Below them a female servant protests. The women twist around the central spiral of Paris's lithe body. Susini arranges the figures as if on a stage; both Paris and Helen turn their faces toward the front. Yet, the spiral composition also encourages the viewer to walk around the piece, offering interesting alternate perspectives. From the sides and back, the details of the figures' exertion are visible: as he sinks his fingers into Helen's yielding flesh, the veins on Paris' hands project and Helen's hair flies loose.","8 1 16 x 6 3 16 in.","Black, red, and white chalk","Dutch","Studies of Women","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00000901.jpg","Peter Paul Rubens","84.XM.908.8"

Six of the panels, including this one, show angels with symbols of the Passion. Sustris's drawing style gave clues to aid the craftsman who transformed this image into an etched panel.

"1650 - 1660","This drawing is filled with minute details-most strikingly, the multitude of cherub faces amidst the clouds-and yet it reflects the grandeur of the large altarpiece for which it was made as a preparatory design. The altarpiece was made for the transept of Munich's Jesuit Church of Saint Michael, one of the greatest Counter-Reformation churches in German-speaking lands.As God, angels, and the dove of the Holy Spirit look down from above, the Virgin Mary and Christ child sit atop a throne surrounded by earthly subjects: a cardinal, bishop, and pope on the left, and nobles on the right-including the Duke of Bavaria, who commissioned Friedrich Sustris to oversee the church's design and decoration.Sustris's fine penmanship creates a light and airy atmosphere. Brown ink defines the figures' often-elongated forms over chunky light-gray washes that add some weight to the grounded and floating figures. The ink looks like gold in some areas, contributing an aura of holiness to objects of the Passion presented by the angels. The crown of thorns, cross, and pillar of the flagellation were meant to encourage meditation on Christ's crucifixion. Such lavish displays of iconography throughout the church and exemplified in this drawing expressed a defiant, new Catholicism seeking to convert Protestants.","8 x 5 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","The Dancer Benglia","www.getty.edu art collections images l 05181901.jpg","Jacob van Ruisdael","83.PA.278"
"1653","During an illicit rendezvous with her lover, the Corinthian maiden Dibutade decided to trace his silhouette on the wall of her father's studio. Joseph-Benoit Suve rendered this legend of the invention of drawing in his typically polished drawing technique. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting enhances the theatricality of the scene. The light from a single flame throws large shadows of the lovers' heads onto the wall behind them and creates dark areas under arms and chins, all of which serves to focus attention on their half-lit faces. The same light also highlights the variegated whites on the gathers of Dibutade's toga and the shine of her skin. These carefully observed and skillfully rendered nuances give Suve's drawing a lively quality.Scholars believe that Suve made this drawing as a replica of a similar painting rather than as a preparatory study.","8 1 16 x 6 1 8 in.","Oil on panel","American","Bridge with a Sluice","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00091501.jpg","Jacob van Ruisdael","2005.98.1"
"1650s - early 1660s","This monumental, sun-drenchedItalianatelandscape was drawn by Herman van Swanevelt while he lived in Rome. Swanevelt contrasted dazzling, luminouswashesof shadow on the left with brilliantly illuminated passages on the right created by the paper's whiteness. Similarly, he devised drama by juxtaposing the hard cragginess of the rock formation in the foreground at left with the soft, fluffy trees beyond.Swanevelt's drawing style is based on that of Cornelis van Poelenburgh and Bartholomeus Breenbergh, and sometimes resembles that of Claude Lorrain, all of whom were northern European artists working in Rome. From them, Swanevelt learned to use light to unify a picture and set a mood. In his drawingThe Arch of Septimius Severus, RomePoelenburgh created similar contrasts of light and shade using wash and the luminosity of the bare, white paper. Swanevelt's style was, in turn, influential; Nicolaes Berchem, for example, imitated Swanevelt's monumental compositions and treatment of the warm Italian sunlight.Scholars are uncertain whether Swanevelt drew this scene outdoors from nature or in the studio.","7 7 8 x 6 in.","Black chalk, point of brush, and light and dark graywashes","American","Dead Tree by a Stream at the Foot of a Hill","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00014801.jpg","Jacob van Ruisdael","85.XM.6.4"

On the opposite bank of the river, Swanevelt carefully rendered the specific traits of flora and fauna in typical Dutch fashion.Swanevelt used a subtle technique to draw the viewer's eye into the picture's center: he drew the framing elements at the edges in warm brown ink, while the center opens into brightness.

The practice of painting the lower classes was relatively new at the time, and pictures of the poor were often derisivecaricatures. Sweerts, however, treated his subject with compassion, vividly capturing the woman's inner beauty while accurately recording her external appearance: the loose skin, thinning hair, and wart on the left side of her face.Although the painting is highly finished, Sweerts's rich brushwork is evident in alternately blended and separated strokes of different shades, creating a strong sense of three-dimensional form. This brushwork is especially striking in the head scarf and the collar.","7 7 8 x 6 1 16 in.","Oil on canvas","American","Landscape with a Wheatfield","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00083501.jpg","Sheron Rupp","84.XM.481.2"

"1868","At first glance, there appears to be little of interest in this image. Two barely outlined chimneys rise ghostlike from what the title identifies as a rooftop. Looking again at the date of this image makes its significance clearer. Thisphotogenic drawingnegative was made around four years before the invention of photography was announced to the public, when William Henry Fox Talbot was still experimenting with light sensitive chemistry and optical devices.In this instance he used a camera obscura to project the light that was reflected off the building through a lens fitted onto the camera obscura. A piece of light-sensitive paper was taped at the back of the camera obscura. The reflection of the building was registered on the paper, which produced this sketchy negative image of the building. Talbot conducted these light-sensitivity experiments from mid-1834 until the summer of 1835. In early January 1839, he learned about Jacques Louis Mand Daguerre's impending announcement of hisdaguerreotypeprocess in France; two weeks after Daguerre's announcement, Talbot published his invention of the photogenic drawing.","27 3 8 x 36 1 4 in.","Albumen print","Italian","New Bridge over Potomac River.

"1793","Textiles and plants were the subjects favored by William Henry Fox Talbot's for his earlyphotogenic drawingexperiments. Both were good subjects because of their ability to transmit light and to reveal shapes and patterns according to their density. A textile with a floral pattern, then, must have seemed exceptionally delightful to Talbot's creative and experimental mind.Photogenic drawingsof small objects such as this fraying scrap of linen were made by placing the object on paper that had been made sensitive to light with a combination of silver nitrate and ordinary table salt. The paper with the object on it was then exposed to sunlight. The salt accounts for the image's rich purplish-red color. This photogenic drawing, like most of Talbot's pictures before 1839, is a negative; that is, the actual tones of the object are reversed. One of the earliest photographs in the Getty Museum's collection, it has considerably darkened since the image was made.","10 7 16 x 7 11 16 in.","Albumen print","Italian","Rails of the Manassas Gap Railroad","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06906901.jpg","Andrew Joseph Russell","71.PA.20"

Afterward, he set about perfecting the first negative positive photographic process, thecalotype. Talbot's invention eventually became the basis for photography as it is practiced today.This botanical study resulted from his intensive period of experimentation. Talbot was in correspondence with Sir John Herschel, the preeminent scientist of his day and Talbot's mentor. Talbot created numerous specimen studies that he carefully chronicled and discussed with Herschel. At this stage, Talbot's images were still fairly rudimentary, and almost all were negative images. The splotchy, uneven tones in this image are perhaps the result of the paper not being properly  fixed,  or stabilized. In 1839 Herschel invented  hypo,  a stabilizing fixative bath.","6 1 8 x 5 1 2 in.","Albumen print","Dutch","Wyoming Station, Engine 23 on Main Track","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06907201.jpg","John Russell","96.GB.326"
"1667","William Henry Fox Talbot was still experimenting with the negative positive process in photography when he made this negative of a painting on glass. Because the painting was on a transparent support, Talbot was able to make a direct-copy negative from it. The background of the negative was darkened with ink so that it would appear light when it was printed as a positive. The Getty Museum owns four negatives and two positives of this image. These multiple variants indicate the usefulness of this glass plate in Talbot's experimentation.

"1734","Textiles and plants were the subjects that William Henry Fox Talbot favored for his earlyphotogenic drawingexperiments. Both were good subjects because of their ability to transmit light and to reveal shapes and patterns according to their density. This delicate, balanced botanical specimen is one of Talbot's early experiments with trying to fix, or make permanent, thephotogenic drawingsthat he had begun to produce in 1834. The print was fixed with ordinary table salt, which accounts for its purplish tone.Like most of Talbot's images made before the spring of 1839, this is a negative image. Talbot did not perfect his negative positivecalotypeprocess until 1840, which is perhaps one of the reasons that thedaguerreotypeprocess in France was more immediately popular. Eventually, however, Talbot's invention became more influential because it allowed multiple prints to be made from a single negative.","8 1 4 x 12 3 4 in.","Pen and brown and black ink and brown and grey wash","Dutch","A Street in Jisp on a Winter's Day","www.getty.edu art collections images l 31356501.jpg","Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg","85.PB.225"
"1628","This image of Lacock Abbey, William Henry Fox Talbot's ancestral home in Wiltshire, England, is a negative, or reversed image. Talbot placed inside hiscamera obscuraa sheet of paper that had been made sensitive to light and fitted the camera with a lens. The light reflected off the subject was projected through the lens into the camera and onto the paper. As the shadows and light hit the paper in direct relation to their densities, the tones were reversed, thus creating a negative.In the introductory remarks toThe Pencil of Nature, published by Talbot from 1844 to 1846 and one of the first books illustrated with photographs, Talbot eloquently and proudly distinguished between traditional art media and the images that he could create by means of this new art:  [T]he plates of this work have been obtained by the mere action of Light upon sensitive paper. They have been formed or depicted by optical and chemical means alone, and without the aid of any one acquainted with the art of drawing.  The statement, however, is not entirely true: Talbot's frustration with his own drafting skills while using thecamera lucidaled him to experiment with chemical means to make the images from these apparatuses permanent.","22 1 2 x 35 5 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Dutch","Ulysses at the Palace of Circe","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00063701.jpg","Gaetano Sabatini","88.GC.131"
"1628","William Henry Fox Talbot's image of a graceful and heroic oak tree, one of the first images to be fixed with a  hypo  solution, represents a pivotal development in the history of photography. In 1839 Talbot made public his process for fixing images on paper treated with silver chloride. He fixed his original images, however, with a salt that did not actually remove the silver chloride, leaving the image unstable and still sensitive to light. In 1841, the year this picture was taken, he began printing more stable images by using a fixing agent called  hypo,  which thoroughly removed the silver chloride. Although the fuzziness of Talbot's first prints made his images in some ways less pleasing than the exactness of a daguerreotype, the process did allow multiple positive images to be created from a single negative. In this regard, Talbot's discoveries represent the origin of modern photography.","3 ft. 9 1 4 in. x 2 ft. 10 in. x 1 ft. 3 in.","Black chalk, with some stumping, and white chalk, on buff paper","Dutch","Self-Portrait","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10866801.jpg","Andrea Sacchi","84.GG.808"

This was Talbot's first trip outside of England with his camera, and he was undoubtedly eager to put it to good use.This view outside of an elegant Parisian townhouse shows an active scene. The carriage driver and horses wait curbside, poised to carry passengers to their destination, and the line of arriving and departing carriages rolling across the bottom of the picture suggests a busy boulevard.

Each print in the book, the first commercially published book to be illustrated with photographs, was an original photograph, tipped in, or glued, to its page.On a spring afternoon in Paris, Talbot photographed the street from his hotel, sufficiently high up to provide a sweeping view of the city's spiky rooftops. The streets have just been wetted down to reduce the dust stirred up from the unpaved road.

At 185 feet in height, the Column interfered with the view from the nearby National Gallery and sparked a bitter controversy regarding the physical transformation of the Square. Talbot's image was made from an angle that caused the base of the column to dwarf the buildings in the distance, including the prominent church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Talbot's decision to focus on the base, letting the column itself extend into infinity beyond the image frame, suggests that he thought that the monument was an oversized intrusion.","40 1 2 x 31 1 4 in.","Pen and brown ink and watercolor, stylus incising throughout;versorubbed with black chalk for transfer to panel","French","The Choir and North Ambulatory of the Church of Saint Bavo, Haarlem","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00026301.jpg","Cornelis Saftleven","2001.40"

The foot warmer in the lower left corner symbolizes love, and the bed suggests an amorous relationship between the man and woman, maybe even seduction.Gerard ter Borch always set a mood, creating a subtle psychological interplay between the people in his intimate paintings. He delighted in meticulously describing and contrasting varied textures: the soft pile of the woman's velvet jacket, distinguished from its plump white fur trim; the shimmer of her pearl-colored satin dress; the dog's soft, wavy fur; and the variations of wood grain in the cello, furniture, and floor. He noticed even the most minute details, such as the nails in the floorboards and the brass door handle. Ter Borch created about eleven paintings of female lute players, often repeating themotifsof the woman in the satin gown and fur-trimmed jacket, the dog, the foot warmer, the four-poster bed in the background, and the partially opened door.","7 13 16 x 9 15 16 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, underglaze blue decoration; silvermounts","American","Lidded Ewer and Basin","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00682801.jpg","Francesco Salviati","85.SA.50"

Like Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's heroic character in the play,Faust, photographer Edmund Teske himself was a gifted alchemist. His darkroom experiments sometimes led to brilliant discoveries, as it did with this image.The print's partially reversed tones, especially visible in the subject's robe and beard, resulted from Teske's accidentalsolarizationof the negative. This effect heightens the moment's drama, emphasizing the low, frontal stage lighting, which casts eerie shadows on Mephisto's pallid face. As Teske developed the 8-by-10-inch negatives he had exposed during the theater production, he accidentally flashed this one with light.Teske had always admired Man Ray's solarized photographs but could not find out how they were made. After his own fortuitous discovery of solarization, Teske quickly gained control of the technique and continued using it throughout his career as a means to heighten creative expression.","12 5 8 x 11 7 16 in.","Red chalk heightened with white chalk","American","Reclining Male Nude","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00017701.jpg","Giuseppe Salviati","98.XM.20.10"
"17, 1973","We are both poets. Frank Lloyd Wright was not first of all an architect, he was first of all a poet, expressing himself in terms of architecture, and so a building becomes a poetic statement.--Edmund TeskeIn 1936, Edmund Teske spent several weeks at architect Frank Lloyd Wright's living quarters at Taliesin North in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Teske was there to photograph the architect, Taliesin's buildings and grounds, and Wright's apprentices. The creative atmosphere that Teske encountered there made a profound impression on him that lasted throughout his life.For more than three decades beginning in 1940, Teske spent time working on this montage, which represents Wright's achievements. Teske layered and tore his prints and re-photographed them. Wright's portrait and his famous building Fallingwater form the central focus of the montage, overlapping floor plans of architectural studios and images of Taliesin West and North. The seated woman in the lower right is Wright's third wife, Olgivanna. Wright himself floats above a landscape of dilapidated looking traditional architecture and images of ordinary Americans whom Teske saw as symbolic of society.This collage reflects Teske's internalization of the architect's philosophy. Wright had rejected the ornate style of traditional architecture in favor of sleek, simple lines and natural materials. His organic style emphasized the spiritual and symbiotic ties between nature and architecture. Teske assimilated those concepts and combined them with an interest in Vedantic Hinduism, which teaches that time is fluid and cyclical. Teske's homage to Wright suggests his belief in the interconnection of life experiences.","16 7 16 x 11 in.","Pen and brown ink and brownwashover traces of black chalk, heightened with white gouache, on blue paper","American","Christ the Savior above Saints John the Baptist, Jerome, Catherine, and Thomas","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00042101.jpg","Jacques-Franois-Joseph Saly","98.XM.20.12"
"7, 1973","Anything is art depending on what attitude you bring to it. . . . Art is a matter of picking up the mundane and giving it a higher level of expression.--Edmund TeskeThe subject of this Edmund Teske photograph is both elusive and mundane: a discarded piece of paper lying in a field of grass, rumpled from being blown about. What is most noticeable is the pattern of elongated holes that puncture the strip in intervals. These punched holes are obviously manmade; they appear too regularly spaced and square-shaped to be caused by the branches that the paper is snagged on.This image was part of a series of studies that Teske made of his hometown, Chicago, in which he documented the rundown industrial environment on the city's South Side during the late 1930s. This strip of paper once had a purpose: It generated music from a pianola, or player piano, whose keys performed the notes coded as holes in the paper. Now discarded, it could be imagined that a wind gusting across the prairie might cause a soft whistling sound as it passes through the holes. Although the strip of paper no longer performs the music it was meant to play, by photographing it Teske suggested that even in its rumpled state, it is still worth looking at.","7 13 16 x 4 13 16 in.","Marble","German","Faun Holding a Goat","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00127201.jpg","Lucas Samaras","98.XM.20.5"

Maintaining his anonymity, as well as that of his subjects, Edmund Teske observed and photographed passengers engaged in these ordinary commuter activities. His choice of subject matter was not unique: at about the same time, Walker Evans was photographing passengers on the New York City subway. Teske and Evans both appreciated the snapshot aesthetic and the informal poses of passengers absorbed in their activities.","6 7 16 x 8 7 8 in.","Polaroid SX-70 print","German","Photo-Transformation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13136401.jpg","Lucas Samaras","98.XM.20.2"
"6, 1975","At first glance, the subject of this photograph is difficult to identify, but the pattern of holes arranged in concentric circles gives it away. To emphasize the deteriorated state of this kitchen sieve, Edmund Teske combined several experimental darkroom techniques to make this one-of-a-kind print.Teske employed solarization-a process by which some black and white tones are reversed by exposure to light during the development process-and chemical staining, in which the exposed print is alternately developed and exposed to light. The solarization enhances the sieve's unique patterning as well as the blocks of light that draw attention to its form and the blades of grass poking through its eroded bottom. The print's chemical stains and streaks, ranging from reddish-browns to vivid blues, create streaks and colors that evoke the rusting and cracking of the sieve.Teske made this negative in Chicago in 1939 and returned to it many years later to make the print. He did not use traditional toners in his photography. Instead he devised his own duotone solarization technique in the late 1950s, which he applied here. For him, this style of darkroom manipulation resulted in a more organic look in keeping with his philosophy of life. Through his study of Vedantic Hinduism and the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright, Teske felt a strong connection to nature. By choosing a decaying object as his subject and by reworking an old negative, Teske underscored his belief in the cyclical nature of time; that life-forms go through periods of disintegration and rebirth.","8 x 12 3 8 in.","Polaroid SX-70 print","German","Photo-Transformation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13137401.jpg","Lucas Samaras","99.XM.53"

A musician's organization membership book, pieces of correspondence, and a set of smoking pipes personalize the arrangement.Edmund Teske came across this table in a music studio owned by the parents of his lover, Richard Soakup. Mrs. Soakup gave music lessons and operated the studio, which was built next to the Soakup's suburban Chicago home. Teske was probably drawn to these objects because music was one of his passions: He took saxophone lessons and learned to play the piano in his youth.This image also reflects Teske's more prosaic documentary approach during a period in which he aimed to make a  portrait  of his hometown. Teske was always drawn to subjects that were more personal to him, especially the environments of people he felt close to. This photograph has an intimate, candid feel to it because of its composition, in which the selection of carefully arranged objects are thrown slightly off-balance by the randomly stacked books and papers to the left. The result demonstrates the interesting duality of Teske's approach: one that is both formal and casual.","8 13 16 x 8 3 4 in.","Polaroid SX-70 print","German","Photo-Transformation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13137601.jpg","Lucas Samaras","84.XM.126.85"
"6, 1976","All of these intricate parts patterned and designed to fit harmoniously again, to function again for the beauty of motion. Richard was in her and I was under her. Richard was out, I was in and Richard was under. Deep in the guts of her intensity and passion, with the inroads of pain, we loved the same commanding mistress.-Edmund TeskeIn a 1940 letter to his brother, Edmund Teske described this scene, which presents the physical and seductive qualities that he saw in both his car and his teenage lover, Richard Soakup. The image reflects Teske's outlook on human identity, particularly his own fluid approach to sexuality and the idea that a person can embody both masculine and feminine qualities.Soft light draws attention to the youth's curly hair and lithe body, which form a visual contrast to the man's work he is engaged in: repairing a car and getting dirty. For Teske, the male body was as worthy of idealization as the female nude. Soakup is portrayed in a candid way that evokes his sexuality and their intimacy.After moving from Chicago-where this picture was made-to Los Angeles, Teske studied a branch of Eastern philosophy, Vedantic Hinduism, that supported his progressive outlook on human identity. In addition, it taught Teske to believe in fate and chance. Years later, he liked to point out that in this photograph the first four numbers on the car's license plate, 1652, were the same as his Los Angeles street address on Harvard Boulevard.","H:  15 5 8 x L:  18 in.","Polaroid SX-70 print","German","Photo-Transformation","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13136901.jpg","Lucas Samaras","84.XM.126.87"

This effect was created by Teske's use of the solarization process, which causes each prickly thorn to appear electrified.

His attraction to the trees on the estate grew out of his reverence for nature.The reversed tones and varied colors of brown and dark red were achieved by twice exposing the printing paper to light: first while under the negative (made twenty years earlier) in the enlarger and a second time while the print was wet with the developing chemicals. At the second stage of development, the print reacted to the light and changed color from gray to russet, brown, and reddish brown in a process Teske called duotone solarization. His manipulation of the tones produced a sense of mystery and foreboding in the landscape.","H:  2 ft. 6 1 2 in. x W:  4 ft. 3 5 8 in. x D:  2 ft. 3 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","The Sander Family","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04069701.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.83"

He seems aware of being photographed but relaxed and contemplative as he stands in the doorway of his Topanga Canyon studio.Teske and Herms became good friends in the 1960s and shared many ideas about life and art-particularly a fascination for abandoned objects marked by the passage of time. Herms often incorporated discarded items into his sculptural assemblages, while Teske was fond of photographing the same types of subjects. Here, Teske took a similar approach to portraiture as he did to his found-object subjects, aiming to evoke a sense of metaphorical transformation.","11 7 8 x 4 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Peasant Woman, Westerwald","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04097501.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.282"
"1913","This image looks like an album cover or a band poster. Although it was published on the back of The Doors' 1970 compilation album,13, Edmund Teske did not make this photograph for commercial reasons. In the late 1960s he became acquainted with Jim Morrison, lead singer of The Doors. He was drawn to the musician's blend of feminine and masculine attributes and made several portraits of him.Teske made this photograph of Morrison and The Doors in a garage at the back of his Hollywood studio. The other band members-Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, and John Densmore-are gathered next to Morrison and surround a rather totemic-looking bust of Ludwig van Beethoven on a table.While this is a fairly typical-looking band portrait, Teske made it seem far less conventional by superimposing another image with it. The second picture is a close-up of an old and cracked vinyl seat cushion. Teske's vertical framing emphasizes the cushion's swirling texture, which fills the empty space above the bandmembers' heads. This patterning creates a psychological dimension that complements the subjects' thoughtful expressions.","14 3 16 x 9 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver prints","German","Dwarfs","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04069501.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.242"

"1918","On this preserved section of recomposed fragments of a large drinking cup-or skyphos--a man balances himself on his right foot as he lifts his left leg and drinks from a large white cup. Individual figures in amusing poses were often used to decorate red-figured drinking cups destined for use in the symposion. But rather than leaving the background in red clay according to the red-figure tradition, the red figure on thisskyphoshas been applied to the surface of the vase with thick, bright red paint atop a black gloss ground. The details of the youth's anatomy have been incised into the red paint with such precision that only the black gloss is penetrated--the red clay beneath it remains covered. His hair is bound by a fillet painted in the purplish added red that is traditional; likewise red is also the color used for the double groundline on which he balances. His cup, which he grasps by the stem of the foot, was painted in added white on top of the black gloss. This convention typically works better in black-, rather than red-figure, technique. An alternating red and black tongue ornament encircles the complete vase. Notably, the painter seems to have accidentally spattered black gloss on portions of the borders, smearing one of the tongues directly beneath the drinker's right foot. There, he left his fingerprint.This cup offers an example of Six's Technique, named after Dutch scholar Jan Six, who first studied it. It features white, red, and orange designs painted atop of a black-gloss ground, and often includes delicately incised silhouette. The technique was invented around the same time as thered-figure technique, in approximately 525 B.C.  Both feature a light-on-dark appearance that contrasts with the dark-on-light effect of the olderblack-figure technique.","6 7 16 x 9 1 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Farm Couple, Westerwald","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04086001.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.518"

Here Perseus, identified by his winged cap and boots, runs along with his sword drawn. The three gorgon sisters with their winged female bodies and horrifying faces are only slightly distinguished from one another in this unusual portrayal of the myth. Typically, Perseus sneaks up on the sleeping gorgons to behead Medusa, and then the two remaining sisters chase him.A kyathos was a dipper used to ladle wine from large mixing vessels. The shape entered the Athenian pottery repertoire from Etruria, and Athenian artists may have decorated these foreign shapes primarily for export back to Etruria. In fact, this depiction of the Perseus story draws heavily onEtruscanversions. On this kyathos, as on many of the time, the black-figure decoration was not applied on the natural reddish clay of the vessel but on a specially prepared white slip.","6 9 16 x 4 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Young Farmers","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04090501.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.152.152"

Containers for potpourri first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon produced in large numbers from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer. To create potpourri, fashionable women experimented with dried petals and spices to achieve the finest fragrances, some of which were left to mature for up to nine years. Perfumes and potpourri were used liberally to disguise malodorous air, as indoor plumbing was nonexistent and frequent bathing was considered unhealthy.By means of a drawing in the archives of the Svres porcelain manufactory of a similar, but unmounted bowl, scholars have identified the craftsman who made the twisted and coiledgiltbronzemountson this piece. The drawing, dated 1784, has an inscription noting that it was to be mounted by  Tomier,  Pierre-Philippe Thomire, one of the most celebrated bronze casters of the late 1700s.

He chose a flat-bottomed vessel not unlike the gondolas that still ply the waters of his native city. The energetically applied washes and the action of the boatman about to push off from the bank convey a sense of urgency.

His buffoonery and ribald behavior made him an immensely popular figure in Venetian street performances. His Italian name,Pulcinella, suggests that Punchinello's family tree included chickens, an ancestry confirmed by his beaklike nose.Here, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo has depicted the punchinellos on an especially lascivious and even sinister outing. Tiepolo produced more than twenty punchinello drawings, and they were most likely made as independent works for collectors rather than studies for paintings or prints.","12 ft. 3 4 in. x 10 ft. 2 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Painter","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04102201.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.534"

Alexander so esteemed his painter that he presented Campaspe to Apelles as a reward for the portrait.The tale of Alexander and Apelles, a favorite ofRenaissanceandBaroquepainters, celebrates the power and nobility of painting.

This technique, calleddi sotto in s(from below upward) gives the viewer the illusion that the scene is an extension of his space: the ceiling of the church opens up to reveal the events of the miracle. In the upper register, painted in golden hues, God the Father and the dove of theHoly Spiritpreside amidst a chorus of music-making angels.

Artists of the eighteenth century often portrayed saints, martyrs, or those who witnessed miracles with such expressions. Whether this portrait represents a particular religious figure, though, is not known. Giovanni Battista Tiepolo may have made this drawing as a study for a larger painting. In preparation for each section of an oil painting or fresco, Tiepolo made chalk studies of figures' heads, limbs, and hands.With animated strokes, Tiepolo applied red and white chalk to blue paper, a technique favored by Venetian artists for its striking contrast. Dark red strokes define the model's facial features, including a gap between his front teeth; velvety red chalk softens the outlines and contours of his face. White highlights indicate a strong light from above, further hinting at a divine presence.","10 ft. 4 3 4 in. x 17 ft. 1 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Gentleman Farmer and Wife","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04087601.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.108"

The man seems oblivious to his ridiculous looks, an exaggeration that is typical of caricature--a comical style of portraiture.Leonardo da Vinci first sketched caricatures in the 1500s, and Italian artists centuries afterward furthered the genre. Working two hundred years after Da Vinci, Tiepolo drew caricatures like this funny-looking man in addition to the serious subjects for which he is known. He made these drawings as independent works of art, sometimes for his own amusement.

"1926","Giovanni Battista Tiepolo probably created his few landscape drawings for their own sake, purely for enjoyment during summer visits to the countryside. Long admired as an exceptional draftsman, Tiepolo used rapid strokes of ink and dark, fluid washes to evoke the flat terrain and bright sunlight of the Veneto, the region of Italy around Venice.Instead of architectural accuracy or detail, Tiepolo explored light, tone, and texture. Clouds cast shadows on the sunlit building, and even the golden brown shadows on the stone outer wall are suffused with light, but the exact building cannot be identified. To render the quickly sketched large tree, which acts as a foil for the greatmassof this typically Venetian villa, Tiepolo adopted Guercino's dynamicchiaroscuroeffects.","11 ft. 6 3 4 in. x 8 ft. 11 3 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Country Boys, Westerwald","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06026101.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.151"

A quiver of arrows, a bow, and a club-weapons identified with Hercules-lie near the centaur. The centaur's head is thrown back, and he reclines as if dead, but the faun's joyful expression conveys otherwise. Although the original tale is about seduction and attempted rape, Tiepolo suggests here that the lovemaking is consensual.Tiepolo's loose drawing style seems appropriate for this fantasy world.

The tonal nuances of golden washes throughout the sheet are characteristic of Tiepolo's style. Divine light pours in from the direction to which Christ points, and the large column along the center of the sheet stands in shadow against the masonry wall. Tiepolo created this large drawing as part of an extensive Biblical series of more than 250 sheets depicting scenes from the lives of Christ and the Apostles. He conceived each drawing in the series as an independent work of art.","25 1 2 x 38 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Blacksmiths","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04072001.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.195"

Other characters, also wearing masks, stand around watching the scene, preparing a chair for the weary Punchinello and fetching an umbrella.Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo produced this drawing as part of a series of 103 works dealing with specific episodes in the life of Punchinello, entitledDivertimento per li ragazzi(Diversions for Children). The scenes, whose themes range from amusement to tragedy, illuminate the complex character of the hunchbacked fool. As a testament to Tiepolo's fondness for this subject, he decorated his family home, Villa Ziani, with images from the series.Tiepolo sketched the drawing first in black chalk, which was easy to change, before drawing in the figures with pen, ink, and brown wash. The numerous black chalk lines that still remain suggest that the artist made several changes to the design before he settled on this scene.","13 9 16 x 19 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Part-time Students","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04074001.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.277"

The bed would have been placed sideways against a wall, with a draped baldachin, now missing, above. The large wheels allowed servants to pull out the body of the bed easily, leaving the tall back attached to the wall while they made it up. It was probably set into an alcove or niche in the bedroom wall.In eighteenth-century France, a bed of this shape was called alit  la turque(Turkish bed) because of its two scrolling ends. This title does not refer to any specific Turkish design source but reflects the eighteenth-century preoccupation with anything exotic and unusual from foreign countries. Turkey, China, and Egypt were among the places that inspired craftsmen in their creation ofromanticand luxurious interiors. The intention was not to accurately recreate foreign objects but to impart a feeling of exotic opulence, even if only through the name attached to an object. The fashion for things  Turkish  peaked in the middle of the 1700s, whenMadame de Pompadourhad a bedroom that was known as thechambre  laturque(Turkish bedroom) only because the paintings displayed in the room showed a slave girl presenting a cup of tea to a sultaness.","38 x 53 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Architect's Wife","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04076301.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.498.9"

Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes.

Each sketch shows Atlas from the same tilted angle, in acontrappostostance with his right foot slightly raised and his head twisted to look under his bent left arm. Each figure sits at a sharp diagonal angle, as though it had been twisted and compressed within the confines of the page and was trying to break free. Atlas's contorted position increases the overall sense of energy and muscular strength. Although each figure's position remains nearly the same, Tintoretto subtly varied the surface shading throughout. Delicate lines of parallel hatching emphasize the rippling, bumpy muscles that cover Atlas's arms, legs, and chest.Tintoretto and his workshop made at least fifteen drawings based on the statuette. The stock figure appears in a number of his paintings.","11 3 8 x 8 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Writer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04088801.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.126"
"1927","Resting her head on her hand, a voluptuous woman stretches across the sheet and displays the rounded curves of her nude body. In this quick sketch, Domenico Tintoretto conveyed the model's languorous repose as she relaxes, head thrown back and legs outstretched. The artist focused on the central part of her body in the upper right corner. His confident strokes of black chalk define the sensuous curves of her body, while quickly-drawn white chalk lines add texture and substance to her form. In this sketch, Tintoretto also explored different ways to position his model on paper. This is most visible in her face, where the outlines of two poses overlap.Tintoretto probably made this sketch for future use in a mythologicalcomposition, as both the woman's pose and form resemble the figure of the goddessVenusin contemporary Venetian artworks. But the artist's will, which mentions  150 studies from nature after men and 50 after women,  reveals his general fascination with the human figure.","18 1 2 x 9 7 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Wife of Peter Abelen, a Painter in Cologne","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04709701.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.259"
"1927","Costumed in the latest style and surrounded by fashionable decorative objects, the Marquise de Miramon wears a rose colored, ruffled peignoir, or dressing gown. Around her neck are a black lace scarf and a silver cross. Reflecting the new European fascination with Japanese art, behind her is a Japanese screen depicting cranes on a gold ground, and on the mantelpiece are several pieces of Japanese ceramics. The needlework on the Louis XVI stool indicates that the subject is a noble woman of leisure, and the eighteenth-century terracotta bust suggests her husband's aristocratic heritage.Thrse -Stephanie-Sophie Feuillant (1836-1912) was from a wealthy bourgeois family. She inherited a fortune from her father and in 1860 she married Rne de Cassagnes de Beaufort, Marquis de Miramon. She stands in the Chteau de Paulhac, Auvergne, her husband's family seat.Tissot painted many fashionable women during his career, but he held this work in particularly high regard. In 1866, he wrote to request, and received, permission to borrow the painting and submit it to the Paris World Fair, where it was seen in public for the first time. The family kept this letter from Tissot along with a swatch of the Marquise's pink velvet gown.

Tissot, who often drew and painted people in introspective states of mind, captured her sitting pensively in a rocking chair. She seems lost in thought, staring forward. The fingertips of her right hand barely rest against her pale cheek while her legs extend to reach the chair's footrest. He portrays the woman's clothes realistically, carefully depicting her black-and-white plaid tunic, and juxtaposing it with the brown-red tartan of her skirt. A hat wrapped in gauzy fabric surrounds her shock of strawberry-blonde hair. Tissot usedheighteningto create vivid and shinyhighlightsalong the chair's frame, while gentle shadows fall beneath the chair, adding depth.

"1928","He was a handsome gentleman, well built and tall . . . who was always exquisitely dressed and well perfumed--in peacetime and in wartime--right down to the saddles of his horses.-- The Abbot of BrantmeTitian's Portrait of Alfonso d'Avalos, painted in Bologna in the winter of 1533, signals the inception of one of the most influential prototypes in the history of Western art-the standing state portrait. Dressed in armor with a diminutive page looking up to him, Alfonso d'Avalos exudes the tremendous power he wielded as governor of Milan and commander general of imperial forces in Italy under the Holy Roman Emperor,Charles V. As the Abbot of Brantme--a French historian--observed, Avalos was a man who took great care with his appearance. He was born into an illustrious Spanish-Neapolitan family and trained for a military career under his cousin, Ferdinando Francesco, the Marchese di Pescara. After winning numerous military campaigns, Avalos was honored with theOrder of the Golden Fleece. He is shown wearing the Order's royal collar over an elaborate and beautifully wrought suit of armor befitting an imperial leader. In the lower left, his page hands him a helmet. Titian, who may have known Avalos personally, endowed him with all the earnestness of a learned and contemplative man, while at the same time conveying his authority.Titian, along with Raphael, set the standard for court portraiture during the subsequent development of Western painting. This portrait heralds such remarkable later paintings as Anthony van Dyck'sPortrait of Agostino Pallavicini,Domenico Fetti'sPortrait of a Man with a Sheet of Music,and Guercino'sPopeGregory XV.","40 3 4 x 51 3 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","High School Student, Cologne","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04073801.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.132"
"1928","In this masterful drawing of a nude man hoisting a rudder on his shoulder, Titian used the blue paper that artists in Venice so often favored. The blue served as a middle tone, with the shadows and outlines drawn in black chalk and the rippling back muscles highlighted in white. Just as in his characteristically textural paintings, Titian combined the three colors to fully model a three-dimensional figure. The smudgy, roughly applied black chalk accentuates the impression of the varied play of light over a sculptural form. The figure's unusual, slightly twisted pose is the focus, rather than such details as the man's facial features.","4 7 8 x 3 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Bassoonist","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04087001.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.135"
"1928","This painting of a repentant Mary Magdalene lifting her teary eyes to heaven was meant to inspire a greater spiritual devotion, at a time when Catholicism was being challenged by theProtestantreformation. Owing to the popularity of the subject, Titian and his workshop made at least seven versions of this painting.X-raysof the painting revealed that Titian made numerous changes to thecomposition, suggesting that he used this canvas to work out his ideas over a considerable period of time. This Getty painting is unique because it is the only composition that shows the Magdalene'sBibleresting on a cloth-covered support rather than a skull--a symbol used to invite contemplation of death.Images of Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman whomJesusfound worthy to redeem and who would spend the rest of her life in solitude to atone for her sins, were especially prevalent during the Counter-Reformation, a period of devout Catholicism that lasted from approximately 1540 to 1640. Upon seeing Titian's conception of Mary Magdalene, the art historian Vasari declared that the picture  profoundly stirs the emotions of all who look at it; and, moreover, although the figure Mary Magdalene is extremely lovely it moves one to thoughts of pity rather than desire.

"1928","The goddess Venus tries to restrain her lover Adonis from going off to the hunt. She clings to him, imploring him not to go, but Adonis looks down at her impassively. His dogs strain at their leashes, echoing his impatience, as detailed in the tragic love story found in Ovid's Metamorphoses. Cupid sleeps in the background, a symbol of Adonis's resistance to Venus's entreaties, since his ineffective arrows hang uselessly in a tree. The story ends tragically; during the hunt the mortal Adonis is fatally gored by a wild boar.Titian's loose, energetic strokes of paint give the painting a sense of spontaneity and movement. In some areas, the artist even painted with his finger, as seen in Adonis's arm. The composition's dynamism springs from the torsion caused by Venus's awkward pose, which was inspired by an ancient sculptural relief. Titian used rich colors, shimmering highlights, and a lush landscape to create the painting's evocative, poignant mood.","2 1 2 x 1 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Courtyard Musicians","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04070001.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.170"
"1928","Known in his paintings for exploring the effects of light on surfaces, Titian here showed that he could achieve similar results with line. His meticulous execution and concern for detail suggest the light, space, and variety of physical forms in the landscape. He suggested textures through varying styles of line, from the loose sketchiness of the puffy trees at the left to the more detailed, yet fluidly rendered, drapery on the female figure at the right. Carefully and economically placed hatchings capture the goat's shimmering fur. Titian even created air with line, as in the atmosphere that envelops the distant city.The subject is enigmatic, though it may relate to the erotic mythologies that Titian was painting for King Philip II of Spain at about the same time. The underlying theme may be Idleness or Indolence, represented by the two shepherds lounging in the shade with their flock of sheep. Indolence may lead to Lust, personified by the female nude whose face is covered and accompanied by her attributes, the goat and the boar.","32 3 4 x 25 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Industrialist","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04074401.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.171"

Cock fighting was a favorite sport of Athenian youth. The cockfight came to be seen as a metaphor for human combat, with many fighting birds named after Greek mythological heroes. Cock imagery also has an erotic element in Athenian art, since cocks were a favorite gift from men to their boy lovers. Little Master cups, so named for their detailed miniature decoration, were introduced around 560 B.C. With a taller, slimmer profile than earlier cups, Little Master cups are divided into lip cups and band cups, easily differentiated by the placement of their decoration.Standard lip cups are decorated with a compact scene of one to three figures centered on each side of the lip, with an inscription below, in the zone between the handles.

This viewpoint--with the woman observed from above and behind--emphasizes her submissiveness and the spectator's control. The row of small tables and chairs implies a less-than-private setting, perhaps a cafe or brothel. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec explored the worlds of the theater, the cabaret, and the brothel--what the poet Charles Baudelaire called  the pleasures of Parisian life.  Edgar Degas's series of pastel bathers, which were exhibited at the eighth Impressionist exhibition in spring 1886, may have inspired this particular subject and unusual angle of view.To quickly capture the scene, Toulouse-Lautrec used tempera or casein, both quick-drying, opaque media that emphasize individual strokes rather than smooth modeling. The layered, linear strokes of pastel colors impose a common texture on the picture's various elements: skin, hair, cloth, wood, and wicker.","H:  5 1 2 in.; W:  8 3 4 in. x  D: 6 5 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Member of Parliament (Democrat)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04078001.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.188"

By the time Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was thirty-five, he was suffering from alcoholism and dementia, most likely brought on by syphilis. His behavior was unpredictable, and often violent. Desperate, his mother had him committed to a clinic, then known as an asylum, outside of Paris.While in the clinic, Toulouse-Lautrec set upon the idea of creating a series of circus drawings to demonstrate his emotional stability and thus secure his release. Drawn from memories culled over many years of attendance at this popular entertainment, these works reveal his acute observation of horses, dogs, acrobats, clowns, and bareback riders. In this image, a performer still wearing her slippers follows a lumpy horse into the arena to perform for the spectators in the stands. Toulouse-Lautrec elongated the shadows behind the slippers to emphasize the woman's fatigue. Upon being released from the clinic after only three months, Toulouse-Lautrec declared:  I bought my freedom with my drawings.

Waves dash to pieces a barely visible ship in a storm several miles beyond Land's End, the westernmost point of England, guarded by a lighthouse called Long Ship's. Aesthetician John Ruskin wrote of this drawing that Turner captured  the whole surface of the sea . . . undirected, bounding, and crashing, and coiling in an anarchy of enormous power. To convey the experience of nature's turbulence, Turner used the full range of watercolor technique, from transparentwashesin the sky to thickbodycolorin the water and rocks. He added highlights to enrich the texture and atmosphere, blotting the wash to reveal the white of the paper in the lighthouse and scratching directly into the paper to render the flecks of light in the waves crashing over the boat. With these bold techniques, Turner came close to modern abstraction in his efforts to expand the expressive and stylistic range of landscape painting.He made this watercolor for a series of engravings entitledPicturesque Views in England and Wales, published between 1827 and 1838.","H:  7 1 2 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Young Girl in a Circus Caravan","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04083501.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.175"

Tones of brown paint near the bottom of the canvas give a sense of the sea's violent power.On the foredeck of a ship that strains against the waves, a man stands in a white uniform and waves with confidence. While scholars are uncertain of the exact historical event Turner described, one probable interpretation is that the man depicted here is Dutch naval officer Cornelis Van Tromp, who was dismissed from naval service in 1666 after failing to follow orders. Van Tromp was reinstated in service and reconciled with his navy superiors in 1673. In perhaps a symbolic overture signaling his submission to authority, Tromp is shown, in Turner's words,  going about to please his Masters.

"1930","This delicately modeledMadonna and Childdisplays a type of hushed beauty lost with the advent of the HighRenaissancestyle in Italy. Once artists began using one-pointperspectiveto present landscapes, architecture, and figures in three well-rounded dimensions, painting became a window on the physical world rather than merely the spiritual one.In an effort to  open up  the scene, the artist from Paolo Uccello's workshop placed a landscape behind the Virgin andChrist. Instead of trying to show depth, however, the countryside simply forms a pattern of almost abstract trees and zigzags. The resulting design has a flatness and regularity that subtly enlivens the picture and complements the elusive three-dimensionality of the figure group.An earlier owner of this painting partly rubbed off the Madonna's bronzehaloduring a cleaning, perhaps assuming that there would be gold underneath.","36 x 26 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Confirmation Candidate","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04075101.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.273"

This particular drawing of an imaginary, idyllic panorama was made as a highly finished, independent work of art and was probably an elaboration of one of his early morning sketches.The composition displays van Uden's most familiar motifs, many of which derive from Peter Paul Rubens's work: cattle and the woman balancing a milk container on her head, the shimmering birch trees at left, and a path leading to a deep vista that opens onto a flat landscape punctuated by a church spire. Sunlight filters through the scintillating leaves of trees on the left, an effect that van Uden so favored that he often made it the focal point of his drawings.","15 x 28 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Blind Man, Congenitally Afflicted","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04078701.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.428"

"1930"," They all want to go and dress up,  Doris Ulmann remarked of her portrait subjects. She preferred to photograph her subjects in their daily wear and in their day-to-day habitats, but clearly the opportunity to have a portrait made without charge proved too tempting to resist for Ulmann's mostly poor subjects. Like most sitters, they chose to have themselves represented at their very best.In this image, Grace Combs appears to be one of those rarely photographed subjects. A natural beauty, Combs comports herself for the camera in a very self-assured, almost seductive pose. She leans on a potted fern, gazing directly into the camera. When this picture was made, Combs was probably a student at Hindman Settlement School in Kentucky.","9 7 16 x 14 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Blind Veterans, Dren","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04088401.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.152.183"

In the 1920s and 1930s, Ulmann, a woman of means from New York, documented what she perceived to be a vanishing black culture. The woman is posed with her hands in her lap, her lips pursed, and her bespectacled eyes gazing directly at the viewer.

The subject, known as Maum Duck, has been variously identified as a midwife or voodoo doctor. She is dressed for an outing, possibly for church, wearing a large, textured hat with her delicate pocketbook dangling from her left arm. Her crisp, white cotton dress and the simple, white sheet backdrop contrast sharply with her rich, deep skin tone and her hat and sash. They contrast so much, in fact, that Duck's facial features become somewhat lost in the balance of highlights and shadows. She stands close to the sheet, nearly blending into it as she casts virtually no shadow. The photograph's casual feeling derives from its incidental details: the gentle sag of the backdrop fabric along the top and the triangle of space where it pulls away at the lower right.","15 1 4 x 8 9 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Ash Wednesday Carnival","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04237201.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.498.14"
"1930","InRoll, Jordan, Roll, novelist Julia Peterkin's and Doris Ulmann's collaborative study of the vanishing Gullah culture of coastal blacks in the Southeastern United States, Peterkin described the pivotal age for a girl in Gullah folklore:Twelve is the age of responsibility, when the recording angel in heaven writes a child's name in a book and marks down every sin against it. Under twelve a child is a 'young child,' and if he dies his soul will not fail to reach heaven, but twelve is the deadline age that changes a 'young child' to an 'old child.'This unnamed young girl, perhaps not yet twelve years old, stands within a shaft of shadow. The wall on either side of her is bathed in light, yet she is moored between, in darkness except for her left hip and arm, as if undecided about her path.

"1937","Surrounded by a diverse array of onlookers, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius kneels and prepares to raise the holy cross. Barefoot and clad in drab robes, Heraclius has abandoned his fine clothing in order to pass through the gate of Jerusalem with humility. Standing beside Heraclius and clad in a bishop's mitre and white robe is the patriarch of Constantinople, Zachariah. Around this central pair, several spectators have dropped to their knees at the sight of the cross.In 628 A.D., having recovered the true cross from the Persians, Heraclius appeared at the gate of Jerusalem intending to enter in triumph. But as he and his followers approached the gate, stones fell from the walls, blocking his passage. An angel appeared and told him that in his opulent clothes, he could not enter through the same gate that Christ had humbly entered riding on a donkey. The message of this story is clear: the kingdom of heaven is open only to those who have forsaken the riches of the material world.The Exaltation of the Cross, in the form of a narrative series, appeared in several early Renaissance frescoes. But it is a subject rarely represented in painting. Juan de Valds Leal frequently used painted sketches to work out his ideas for large-scale compositions. This oil sketch was created for his last major commission, a monumental fresco to decorate the church of the Hospital de la Caridad in Seville, Spain This preparatory form highlight's Valds Leal's agitated brushwork, thick impasto, vivid coloring, and dramatic sense of movement. Such painterly spontaneity perhaps reflects the spiritual fervor of this famously volatile painter.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Gelatin silver print","German","Master Mason","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04709801.jpg","August Sander","84.XM.126.68"

In the distance, sailboats move in and out of shafts of rain as they traverse a thin sliver of turquoise sea.Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes exhibited this landscape at the Salon of 1789.

In this hunting trophy picture, van Aelst rendered the brightly colored birds and wide range of surfaces and textures with the same lushness he devoted elsewhere to crystal goblets and silver platters. He painted the birds so carefully that they can be accurately identified: the blue-green one is a kingfisher, the small red one is a Eurasian bullfinch, and the yellow-brown bird is a male bearded tit.Few Dutch artists actually painted dead game and fowl, perhaps because hunting and shooting was not widely practiced in the northern Netherlands.

He used a variety of fine, hatched lines to describe the soft contours of the face and distinctive texture of the fur.

Three men in broad-brimmed hats stand supervising on the left, while other sailors await the goods or attend to other vessels.Using brown ink, Willem van de Velde the Elder outlined the boats and gave definition to ropes and shipping tackle. In contrast, he used a blue-graywashto give volume and depth, using only a few simple strokes to suggest the folds of the sails. Building up the human figures by blending wash and ink, he made quick, sure lines that evoke each gesture and costume without many specific details.

Van Dyck exchanged Titian's sweeping horizontal composition for a more tightly integrated, vertical format, allowing him to give greater prominence to the shrouded Virgin, who holds the arm of her dead son. The gracefully turning form of Saint John the Evangelist at the center links the two figures flanking Christ.Van Dyck demonstrated his virtuosity by using a variety of techniques and media in his characteristically intense, heavily washed, and broadly drawn style. After sketching in black chalk, he drew the figures in pen and ink and went over much of the composition with strokes of dark brown wash. He also drew a rough framing line around the composition. The extremely fine pen lines left visible on Christ's torso lend it poignant beauty, while the wash adds drama and movement.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Gold","Italian","Ring with Bellerophon Spearing the Chimaera","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01505901.jpg","Santi di Tito","83.GA.382"
"1603 - 1609","Depicted three-quarter length, the Earl of Arundel sits before a tapestry curtain on the left and a landscape background on the right. The long, tapering fingers of his left hand hold the goldmedallionof Saint George, one of theemblemsworn by the twenty-four knights who made up the most eminent and noble circle around the king. His elongated, pale face contrasts with the white ruff around his neck and the scarlet chair upon which he sits. Turned slightly towards the viewer, the expression on Arundel's face is alert but reserved.Arundel was one of the great patrons and collectors of art in England in the early 1600s. He was best known for his collection of Venetian paintings, which included works by Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese. During a brief first visit to London around 1621, Anthony van Dyck was commissioned to paint this portrait for Arundel, who recognized the young artist's talent.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and black chalk on blue paper","Italian","The Resurrection","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00016201.jpg","Saraceni, Carlo","2008.73"
"1606 - 1609","Agostino Pallavicini, a member of the Genoese branch of the Pallavicini family and the future doge of Genoa, sits enveloped by the sumptuous, flowing red robes worn in his role as ambassador to the Pope. The wide expanse of fabric, spectacularly rendered, seems to have a life of its own and almost threatens to take over the painting. The luxurious swirl of cloth, its brilliant sheen, and the way it glimmers and reflects light display Anthony van Dyck's virtuosity as a painter. The family coat of arms seen on the drapery behind the sitter at the left, along with other documented portraits, firmly establishes Pallavicini's identity.In 1621 Van Dyck left Antwerp and traveled to Italy, where he stayed for five years, viewing large private collections of Italian paintings and painting various portraits. This was one of the first paintings he made in Italy, painted in 1621 to commemorate the sitter's service as an ambassador to the newly elected Pope Gregory XV.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Black chalk, heightened with white chalk on blue-green paper","Italian","Papal Authority","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00003201.jpg","Roelandt Savery","83.GB.381"
"1617","Anthony Van Dyck's former teacher, Hendrick van Balen, lived in Antwerp and painted religious and mythological themes. Van Dyck made this portrait as a study for a print that was part of a series known asThe Iconography. This series was a collection of portraits of distinguished artists, soldiers, statesmen, administrators, and scholars of the early 1600s.Using only black chalk, Van Dyck created a striking characterization of his old teacher. By placing Van Balen's right hand on the head of an antique bust while his left presses a soft cloth close to his chest, Van Dyck effectively suggested the erudition and refined personality of his mentor.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and graphite","Italian","Seated Woman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00005701.jpg","Roelandt Savery","85.PA.162"
"1620s","Near death after being tied to a tree and shot through with arrows, Saint Sebastian barely notices the angel helping to remove them. Anthony van Dyck painted the subject of Saint Sebastian many times, choosing various moments in the saint's story but never focusing on the one thing that most other artists emphasized: the saint's flesh punctured with arrows. Van Dyck's goal was to explore the subject's emotional possibilities, rather than the physical wounds. In this scene, the naked and defenseless Saint Sebastian is so consumed by suffering that he is practically unaware of the angel's assistance.Using a monochromatic grisaille technique and thin paint, Van Dyck rapidly sketched in his composition, exploring the effect of light and shadow on Christ's torso and the angel's body. He painted this oil sketch in preparation for a painting that was probably never completed or is now lost. It combines the freshness, immediacy, and fluency of a drawing with the monumentality of a large painting. These qualities characterize the Flemish oil sketch, which Peter Paul Rubens first developed as an alternative to drawing and which Van Dyck, his most gifted pupil, soon adopted.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Pen and brown ink and graphite","French","Seated Man","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00005601.jpg","Roelandt Savery","97.PA.55"

Though this country view seems spontaneous, the scene is thoughtfully arranged around the prominent central tree. Anthony van Dyck's rich and translucent colors and the freshness of his watercolor and pen accents lend an almost impressionistic tone to the drawing.Van Dyck regularly sketched from life during relaxed interludes, all the while successfully creating coherent, unified compositions. This watercolor probably records a momentary impression created while at leisure, but it may also have served as a study for the background of a painting. While in England, van Dyck developed a pastoral style that often presented portrait sitters in a landscape.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Oil on panel","French","Landscape with the Temptation of Saint Anthony","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30531901.jpg","Roelandt Savery","83.GB.17"
"1530s"," I also did a bleaching ground at Scheveningen right on the spot, washed in at one sitting, almost without preparation, on a piece of very coarse Torchon [paper],  Vincent van Gogh wrote on 26 July 1882.Displaying his early accomplishment after only six months of working in and around The Hague, the recto and verso of this drawing together offer a fascinating glimpse into van Gogh's working process. He probably began by drawing the Scheveningen woman on the verso. Possibly dissatisfied with its murky effect, he may also have cut down the sheet to its current dimensions. Recycling the high-quality Torchon paper, he turned the sheet over and painted this luminous scene in watercolors as he watched the women at work in the field.With the whites blowing from the fence, van Gogh retained the freshness of the moment and created a sense of motion within an otherwise still landscape. Divergent and well-observed details combine into a single overall scheme, conveying a sense of open outdoor space. Masterfully handling a difficult medium, van Gogh revealed the luminosity of watercolor and hinted at the expressiveness and colorful palette of his art to come.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Black chalk with redwash","Dutch","Landscape with Waterfall","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00005501.jpg","Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo","89.GB.54"
"1533"," A good soul and so wise and so full of feeling and so trustful --thus Vincent van Gogh described his friend Joseph-Etienne Roulin. Van Gogh drew and painted many portraits of Roulin, a postal worker in Arles, where Van Gogh lived from 1888 to 1889. In letters and pictures, Van Gogh idealized Roulin, regarding him as both a man of the people and a sage.Facing frontally, Roulin is pushed close to the picture plane, with his eyes looking slightly wistfully to the side. Van Gogh's energetic lines describe Roulin's full beard, his facial structure, and his somewhat crooked nose. With the dark, thick lines of a reed pen, Van Gogh hatched the vibrating coat and cap. Behind Roulin, a patchwork of nervous, intersecting lines drawn with a quill pen creates an overall surface tension, reinforcing the energy emanating from the sitter and the unsettled nature of his gaze.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Oil on canvas","German","Shepherd with a Flute","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00088201.jpg","Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo","83.DD.260"

In the center, a man scythes a section of the field while a woman bundles cut wheat under her arm. The background shifts to the cityscape of Arles, where churches and densely packed houses stretch across the horizon. A railroad train and factories churning smoke into the sky signal the dawn of the machine world and its effect on traditional ways of life.This drawing embodies many of the characteristic features of van Gogh's work: remarkably varied graphic strokes, a subject matter that comments on the human condition, a golden glow that suggests the warm light of southern France, and a balanced yet dynamic composition.","10 1 16 x 6 13 16 in.","Oil on canvas","Dutch","Saint Mary Magdalen at the Sepulchre","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11311501.jpg","Giovanni Girolamo Savoldo","75.DD.1"
"1714 - 1740","In May 1889, after episodes of self-mutilation and hospitalization, Vincent van Gogh chose to enter an asylum in Saint-Rmy, France. There, in the last year before his death, he created almost 130 paintings. Within the first week, he beganIrises, working from nature in the asylum's garden. The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints.There are no known drawings for this painting; Van Gogh himself considered it a study. His brother Theo quickly recognized its quality and submitted it to theSalon des Indpendantsin September 1889, writing Vincent of the exhibition:  [It] strikes the eye from afar. It is a beautiful study full of air and life. Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines. The painting's first owner, French art critic Octave Mirbeau, one of Van Gogh's earliest supporters, wrote:  How well he has understood the exquisite nature of flowers!

Dressing herself so as to catch the eye of any man who might see her, Judith entered the enemy camp and quickly entranced the general with her beauty. He invited her to his tent with plans to seduce her, but became too drunk. She was therefore able to grab his sword and sever his head.The decapitated body of Holofernes, with its gushing wound, lies on a canopied bed in the elaborate tent to the right. Judith herself wears an intricate armored breastplate over her richly embroidered clothes. In the distance, the other Assyrian tents cluster outside the city walls, while the army marches up to the gate.Van Heemskerck's careful cross-hatching and neat penwork indicate that this was a final version of this drawing.

Both men and women enjoyed practicing their calligraphic skills by decorating bottles, plates, beakers, and other glass vessels with elaborate lettering. One of the most accomplished of these was Willem Jacobszoon van Heemskerk, who engraved and signed this bottle on its base. Heemskerk was an able engraver and an inspired designer who covered the surface of his glass vessels with pithy adages in delicate script.

Cupid, however, foiled his mother's plans, and Psyche did not fall in love with any such wretched creature. Having pricked himself with his own arrow so that he would love Psyche, Cupid protected her.

The sure ink lines and lack of correction display van Mander's instinctive draftsmanship.As part of their teaching at the drawing school they formed, known as the Haarlem Academy, Van Mander and his friends made sketches of single nude figures, often in strikingly difficult, contorted poses.

Vasari arranged the scenes according to a Counter-Reformation formula: At the top, an Elder of the Apocalypse, angels, and helmeted holy figures appear bearing instruments of the Passion. Below that are the Divine Tribune of Saints and an Archangel, flanked by Fortitude and Patience, who greets the saved rising from Purgatory.

In the form of a dove, theHoly Spiritdescends, flying close to the Virgin's face. Paolo Veneziano skillfully placed his figures within the difficult confines of the small trapezoidal space. The depiction of Mary's throne presented a challenge to the artist, but he set it at an angle thus, giving a sense of depth. He used the space above Gabriel by sweeping the angel's wings upwards so that the feathery ends touch the point where the frame meets the panel. The Virgin's facial features, her hieratic pose, and the decorative patterning of her dress and the cloth of honor draping her throne all illustrateByzantineconventions of the past. But the figure of Gabriel shows a more modern influence: The innovations of Giotto and other Tuscan artists are seen in the way Veneziano has given the figure a weightiness and bulk achieved through sculptural modeling.","32 1 4 x 22 in.","Oil on panel","American","Madonna and Child in a Window","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11229401.jpg","Martin Schongauer","2002.8"

The sculptor Rombout Verhulst conveyed the figure's motion and spontaneity through the twisted head, furrowed brow, and pursed lips. Verhulst's facility in differentiating textures--Van Reygersberg's shield has a smooth hardness, his cravat a lacy delicacy, and his skin an unusual, satiny texture-heightens the realism. Decorative scrolls, which also lead the viewer's gaze up toward the subject's face, is soften the figure's sudden truncation at mid-chest.Jacob van Reygersberg was a wealthy provincial politician who had recently been sent to the States General, the national governing body of the Netherlands, to represent the Dutch province of Zeeland.

They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings. Beginning in the 1660s, such engravings were available in France through the published accounts of Jesuit missionaries and the Dutch East India Company.","4 1 4 x 3 3 8 in.","Black and white chalk, pricked for transfer on two joined sheets of tan paper; silhouetted","French","Cartoon of the Head of Saint James","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00000601.jpg","Sebastiano del Piombo","2002.51"

For over forty years, wealthy patrons ordered hangings from the series.Not only the decorative subject matter, which contrasted with the more formal biblical and historical themes of other contemporary tapestry series, but also the flexibility of the design made it popular. Weavers could easily adapt the composition and change the dimensions to fit a specific location without losing the meaning of the design.

At least some of the beasts may have been drawn from life at the royal menagerie at Versailles.In addition to animals and birds--a camel, leopard, lion, peacock, and parrots--this tapestry features human figures. These theatrical performers wear half-masks, and were based on characters from a popular form of street theater, theCommedia Dell' Arte(Comedy of Art). On the tapestry's left side, a violinist and a tambourine player accompany a tightrope walker. On the right, a jesterlike figure tends to the camel. Between them, cherubs perform precariously from ropes hanging down from a central cornice, with a peacock perched below them. Above, parrots balance on canopies hung beneath two trellises and amidst an assortment of swags, urns, and other ornate elements.Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, who designed this tapestry, is best known as an artist of floral still-life paintings in the Dutch tradition.

A powerful figure in the 1600s and 1700s, the keeper of seals acted as minister of justice and was second in command to the chancellor of France.

In revenge, she left a note accusing him of defiling her, and committed suicide. His enraged fatherTheseusbanished Hippolytos and begged the gods to destroy him.

In this drawing, produced outside as an exercise in sketching, Vernet followed his own advice. Focusing on the combination of sunlit rock, overgrown trees, and undergrowth that formed the entrance to the murky tunnel opening at the back, he concentrated on a factual representation of the scene, including the fine roadside tomb on the left. The small chink of light in the midst of the shadow marks the other end of the tunnel, giving a sense of its length and breadth.Known as theGrottoat Posilipo, this tunnel, cut by the Romans to link Naples with the town of Pozzuoli, was a famous tourist attraction in the 1700s. Visitors admired it both for the drama of its tall, dark, and narrow space and as a feat of Roman engineering.","9 7 8 x 16 3 8 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, pink and green ground colors, polychrome enamel decoration and gilding","French","Pair of Vases","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00630901.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","70.DA.85"

Vernet's popular views of harbors and ships led to frequent copying and imitation, especially by a group of French artists working in southern Italy who followed his lead in specializing in Mediterranean harbor scenes.In a manner characteristic of Vernet's followers, this painting's peaceful arrangement balances a delicate tree and massive building at the left with an open view on the right. Human architectural constructions frame the intermingled sea and sky.

"1760 - 1765","Claude-Joseph Vernet depicted a storm's aftermath: dark clouds above an angry sea, a shipwrecked boat and its anxious survivors, and listing ships in the distance. As the sea furiously beats against the shoreline, waves explode beyond the rocks in a froth of white. The motion of the waves, the distant rain shaft, the battered ship, and even the bodies of the fleeing castaways fill the scene with strong, opposing diagonal lines. The lighthouse standing solidly upright at the painting's center counters all of this activity.The strong colors of the shipwrecked survivors' clothing stand out against thepaletteof greens, grays, and browns in the turbulent sea. Clearing skies cast the survivors in an eerie glow; dark tones at the left and lower edges and in the waves themselves draw further attention to the bright figures.The scene as a whole suggests the powerful force of nature over man.

Warm tones of yellow, orange and red predominate, suggesting a hazy sunset after a bright day.InA Calm,Vernet portrayed a completely peaceful scene in striking contrast to itspendant,A Storm on a Mediterranean Coast.Taken together, the two works show, on the one hand, nature's benevolence, and on the other, nature's fury.","dome-topped","Soft-paste porcelain, turquoise(bleu cleste)ground color; polychrome enamel decoration, gilding","French","Pair of Lidded Chestnut Bowls","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00663301.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","78.DE.65"

He left out the background, concentrating instead on the arrangement of the seated figures, positioned to illustrate different attitudes of listening and contemplation.Veronese swiftly sketched the figures, outlining only the basic forms and used parallel hatching to suggest areas of shadow, texture, and depth. He used a simple oval form bisected by two lines to suggest the head, eyes, and mouth of Christ and his disciples and did not even bother to draw in their clothing.","20 9 16 x 15 7 8 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, carmine red (camaeu rose) enameled decoration, gilding","French","Covered Cup and Saucer","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00681101.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","89.DE.25"

"1764","A handsome, headless suit of steel armor flexes its arms while dissolving into sketchy lines at the bottom of the torso. The artist repeated an arm on the right side of the sheet, adding more detail of the elbow covering. Drawing from memory instead of copying exactly all the intricate details of an original, he drew various details on one side only, such as the multiple rows of scrolling on the left shoulder and arm.Although these studies do not match any known figures of men in armor by Paolo Veronese, either as portraits or within larger compositions, scholars suspect that Veronese or an artist close to him worked on this sheet. As in known Veronese drawings, this armor is presented as if it contains a gesturing man rather than as a uninhabited still-life form. The diagonal line of white highlights across the shoulder and stomach also closely correspond to a Veronese portrait of a man in armor. The rather broad, suggestive modeling, with sharper, darker chalk lines for emphasis, resembles other drawings by Veronese. With few other works for comparison, scholars remain hesitant about a firm attribution.","15 1 2 x 20 5 8 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, pink ground color overlaid with blue enamel, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","French","Vase (Cuvette Mahon)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00621601.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","85.DE.219"

Veronese and his studio painted the altarpiece from 1574 to 1575, using the drawing as a guide.

Best known for his large decorativefrescocycles, Veronese did not paint many portraits. For him to have taken the time to paint this large, impressive portrait points to the commission's importance.The man leans on the base of a structure with fluted columns. In a niche between the columns is a marble sculpture of a draped female figure, of which only the lower portion is visible. Carvedreliefs, barely discernible, adorn the sides of the architectural base. These clues may refer to the subject's profession, perhaps that of a sculptor or architect. In the background at the lower left is the Venetian basilica of San Marco, placed in an imaginary rural setting. Most likely, the inclusion of San Marco alludes to the sitter's association with the church or the Venetian state.","16 1 16 x 20 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, polychrome enamel decoration,gilding","French","Lidded Bowl on Dish","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00634501.jpg","Pierre-Andr Le Guay","86.DE.520"

"1768","After curing Tobit's blindness, returning the family's wealth, and making it possible for Tobit's son Tobias to marry his beloved Sarah, the Archangel Raphael has dropped his disguise and revealed himself as an angel, saying,  I was not acting on my own will, but by the will of God.  Such a scene of miraculous intervention was especially attractive to Protestants in Holland, who believed in doctrines of faith, mercy, and divine grace.Jan Victors took his subject from the Book of Tobit, among the Apocrypha in the Old Testament. Borrowing elements from his teacher Rembrandt van Rijn's 1637 rendition of the subject, Victors set his figures before and within an architectural setting and opened the composition to a clouded landscape on one side. Strong contrasts of light and dark and a foreshortened angel, flying away on a diagonal and viewed from the back, give the scene animation and urgency. Victors' characteristically careful interpretation of surface details includes beautifully rendered highlights on the costumes and Tobias's head.","2 3 8 x 5 3 16 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, blue(bleu nouveau)ground color,gilding","French","Vase","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00687001.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","79.DE.64"

The book contains Latin prayers devoted toChrist, the Virgin, and the saints and is remarkably embellished with thirty-seven largeminiatures, several smaller miniatures, and decorations on every page. The largest miniatures measure only about three inches on the longest side, but they are incredibly detailed, often with deep panoramic landscapes framed by lush borders.Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy and son of bibliophilePhilip the Good, saw many of his father's unfinished book commissions through to completion; this prayer book is one of the rare commissions Charles initiated himself. The accounts of the Burgundian dukes record payments in 1469 to the scribe Nicholas Spierinc of Ghent, to theilluminatorLieven van Lathem of Antwerp, and to the goldsmith who made the original clasps for the binding of this costly book. Along with Lathem, several anonymous illuminators collaborated on this project, including the Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy. In the 1480s, a series of additional prayers with miniatures by a French illuminator was added to the volume.","2 3 16 x 5 3 4 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, dark blue (beau bleu) ground color, polychrome enamel decoration, and gilding","French","Lidded Vase (Vse a Panneaux)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00674101.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","83.DE.341"

"1773","A pair of large eyes frames busts of the hero Herakles and his patron goddess Athena on one side of this black-figure cup. In the 500s B.C., Greek vase-painters frequently placed eyes on vessels, perhaps because they were believed to be apotropaic--that is, they had the power to ward off evil. The other side of the cup has a similar scene with three busts, one male and two female. The center female was once painted white and wears a type of headdress called apolos, typical of Greek goddesses. These busts, however, are harder to identify than those on the front of the cup. Some scholars identify them as Zeus, Hebe, and Hera, suggesting that the subject of the cup as a whole would be the apotheosis of Herakles, his introduction on Mount Olympus as a god. Other scholars, however, interpret the heads as Hades, Persephone, and Demeter and the cup's theme as Herakles' introduction into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a cult that promised a better afterlife to its followers.","15 x 20 7 16 in.","Soft-paste porcelain, enameled decoration, gilding;giltbronze bases","French","Pair of Vases","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00677001.jpg","Martin Carlin","88.DE.137"

Made from gold, silver,porcelain, orlacquer, containers for potpourri and recipes for their sweet-smelling contents first appeared in the 1700s in France and were soon prevalent. Fashionable women experimented with flowers and perfumes to achieve the finest fragrances, which were sometimes left to mature for up to nine years.Jean-Claude Duplessis, the artistic director of the Vincennes Manufactory probably designed the vases, which were namedpots-pourri Pompadourin honor ofMadame de Pompadour.

Dealers ordered the plaques directly from Svres and then passed them over tobnisteslike Adam Weisweiler with specific orders about the object they should ornament. Themarchandscould therefore offer their clients considerable choice over the final design. In 1785 Weisweiler became the main supplier of furniture mounted with Svres plaques to the dealer Dominique Daguerre.On this work, the porcelain plaques were probably produced before the final position and form of the secrtaire had been determined. The two oval plaques on each side are painted to be viewed horizontally, but they are mounted vertically, with their groups of musical instruments tilted awkwardly on their sides. This orientation suggests that they were not originally intended to be mounted on the same piece of furniture as the three rectangular plaques set on the front.","15 15 16 x 20 9 16 in.","Hard-paste porcelain, pink(rose pointill)ground color, polychrome enamel decoration, gilding","American","Pair of Vases","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00684201.jpg","Antoine Capelle","88.XM.22.1"

"1917","In the publicationBill Viola: The Passions,the artist describes the plot of his videoEmergence:Two women are seen sitting on either side of a marble cistern in a small courtyard. They wait patiently in silence, only occasionally acknowledging each other's presence. Time becomes suspended and indeterminate, the purpose and destination of their actions unknown. Their vigil is suddenly interrupted by a premonition. The younger woman abruptly turns and stares at the cistern. She watches in disbelief as a young man's head appears, and then his body rises up, spilling water over the sides and out onto the base and the courtyard floor.The cascading water catches the older woman's attention, and she turns to witness the miraculous event. She stands up, drawn by the young man's rising presence. The younger woman grasps his arm and caresses it as if greeting a lost lover. When the young man's pale body reaches its fullest extension, he totters and falls. The older woman catches him in her arms, and with the help of the younger woman, they struggle to lower him gently to the ground. Lying prone and lifeless, he is covered by a cloth. Cradling his head on her knees, the older woman finally breaks down in tears as the younger woman, overcome with emotion, tenderly embraces his body.As a work of art,Emergencetranscends this--and probablyany--literal description. The video resembles a painting because it is framed, mounted into a wall, silent, and the narrative occurs in extremely slow motion. As a rear-projection installation, it assumes an otherworldly glow. Although the plot suggests biblical stories such as Christ's Resurrection, such metaphorical associations are ambiguous: For example, the man rising out of a fountain of water implies birth, but his body, when laid out on the ground, suggests death.It is the viewer's participation almost as a bystander to a miraculous event, however, that makes the work mesmerizing. During the nearly twelve-minute video, the observer experiences the same extended passage of time as the women waiting by the well. This deliberate slowing down of sensual input encourages a heightened awareness of the characters' every nuanced expression and movement--and in turn, of the viewer's own perceptive process.Emergencewas commissioned by the Getty Museum as part of theBill Viola: The Passionsexhibition organized by the Museum in 2003. The video was inspired by a fresco from the 1400s by Masolino da Panicale, in which the dead Christ is shown at the moment of Resurrection.","15 7 8 x 20 3 4 in.","Hard-paste porcelain","American","Figure Group: Charity","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11154401.jpg","Svres Porcelain Manufactory","2003.12"

Holding symbols of earthly greed-a scepter and crown-the reclining figure represents intellectual and spiritual Blindness.Volterrano showed his great command of the red chalk technique with the figure of Blindness, shaped by soft, richly applied strokes. With sensitivity and economy, he added luminous highlights of white lead. To develop the boundaries of her body and define her relationship to other elements, Volterrano relied on more than contour. For instance, he used the paper, touches of lead white, and the chalk shading that defines the cushions to create the form of her left arm.Volterrano made this drawing for a fresco in a palazzo in Florence. In the fresco, Truth holds a book in her upraised left hand, and additional symbols of earthly greed, including two sacks of money, surround the jeweled figure of Blindness.","4 3 8 x 6 3 4 in.","Red chalk (recto); red chalk and brown ink (verso)","Italian","Figure Studies (recto); Figure Studies (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00024701.jpg","Frans Snyders","97.SB.61"

Simon Vouet experimented with the position of her outstretched arm, first drawing it in at a higher level before partially erasing it and starting again.Vouet applied black chalk in long grace strokes, describing the gentle curves of the woman's arms and body with strong outlines and subtle shading. The shading enhances the impression of mass and solidity. Dark shadows that extend backwards from the feet of both figures also contribute to the illusion of weight and mass.In the male nude onverso, Vouet drew a similarly monumental figure seen from slightly below and readjusted the position of the figure's right arm.

"1710 - 1716","Known both as an astute politician and a connoisseur of the French arts, Cardinal de Richelieu controlled much of France's political and artistic sphere in the 1600s. Simon Vouet drew him in his cardinal's robes while clasping in his hands a letter, an attribute of his life as an official of the Church and the State. Richelieu's direct, incisive gaze holds the viewer's eyes and attention.King Louis XIII commissioned Vouet to produce a series of some thirty portrait drawings of noblemen, artists, and officers of the court in colored chalks on light brown paper. In this highly finished example, Vouet used a combination of red, black, and white chalk. The red chalk shows off the brilliant color of the cardinal's cape and hat, while the white creates soft highlights in his hair and collar. Black chalk lines behind the cardinal give the figure added weight and depth. Finally, layers of pastel on top of the chalk give the surface of the drawing added richness and texture.","15 x 21 3 8 in.","Pen and brown ink and white gouache heightening over black chalk on brown paper","Italian","Christ Carrying the Cross (recto); The Resurrection (verso)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00015501.jpg","Massimiliano Soldani Benzi","91.GG.72"

The youth holds a pomegranate, a symbol of death.In the late 500s B.C., Athenian potters began to cover the natural reddish color of their pottery with a highly purified clay that turned white when fired. Initially, artists applied this technique to a variety of shapes decorated with a wide range of scenes. Just before the middle of the 400s B.C., however, artists began limiting the use of this technique to a specific shape--the lekythos, a small oil container used in funerary ritual--and the decoration on the vessels shifted almost exclusively to funerary scenes. This change was due to the fragile nature of the white slip, which did not wear well but served the one-time usage of a funeral quite nicely.","15 7 8 x 20 3 4 in.","Bronze on gray-green marble bases with bronzemounts","German","Andromeda and the Sea-Monster; Leda and the Swan","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11364501.jpg","Massimiliano Soldani Benzi","84.PA.65"

They asked me who my favorite Disney character was and I said, 'Minnie Mouse, because she can get me close to Mickey.'So wrote Andy Warhol in 1981. Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein had painted Mickey Mouse on a challenge from his young son to prove that he could  draw like the people who did cartoons,  but this made his friend Andy Warhol jealous. Lichtenstein had  gotten to Mickey first,  thus scooping Warhol on representing the popular cultural icon.Lichtenstein and Warhol collected each other's work. As part of a trade between the two artists, Warhol made this Polaroid study in preparation for painting his friend's portrait. He admired Lichtenstein's art, which employed a limited palette of flat primary colors and heavy black outlines in imitation of comic book illustrators and commercial printing methods.","21 x 14 3 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","Spanish","Max Ernst","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04025101.jpg","Frederick Sommer","78.PA.68"
"1966","In the late 1970s, Warhol painted portraits of Liza Minnelli based on his Polaroids. Minnelli, a Hollywood child who first appeared onscreen as a toddler, was an important part of Warhol's inner circle in the 1970s and 1980s. She had formidable show-business parents--singer-actress Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli--and achieved her own lead roles in stage productions only after performing with her mother and working as an apprentice on other musicals. In Minnelli Warhol found a powerfully iconic face with strong elements ready-made for the Polaroid. Her short black bangs, large dark eyes outlined with heavy makeup, and full lips painted a dark red stood out in the print even before they were transferred to silkscreen, which would simplify them even further. Warhol finally chose to paint from another print, rather than from this one. Perhaps he felt that the red-orange hooded dress gave the composition a somber, mourning quality unfit for the sitter's home. On the other hand, Warhol must have appreciated the simple lines and religious overtones of Minnelli's draped head and sad gaze. He portrayed her as an alluring celebrity while suggesting her private burdens.","13 7 8 x 20 3 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","Spanish","Valise d'Adam","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10673401.jpg","Frederick Sommer","79.PA.154"
"1985","In 1979 the Polaroid Corporation invited Andy Warhol to make portraits in its Cambridge, Massachusetts, studio, where the prototype of a new 20 x 24-inch camera that weighed eight hundred pounds and could produce color photographs in sixty seconds had been set up. The bulky apparatus could not easily be moved for compositional changes; it had to remain stationary while the subject was arranged. Then, when all was ready, Polaroid's technician was on hand to operate it. In spite of these restrictions, Warhol seems to have had fun making more than ten portraits--most of them self-portraits.Warhol made four extreme close-up self-portraits with the new camera in a single day, including this one. He seems to have quickly understood that he had to get very close to the enormous camera, to confront it almost, thus making a larger-than-life-size portrait that exploited the camera's unusual potential. He gazed upward and away from the lens, leaving the left side of his face in deep shadow. These elements emphasize and abstract the simple highlighted lines of his face.","14 1 2 x 21 in.","Gelatin silver print","Spanish","Figure","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10672101.jpg","Frederick Sommer","78.PA.75"
"1909","Andy Warhol enjoyed dressing for parties in drag, sometimes in dresses of his own design. He admired  the boys who spend their lives trying to be complete girls,  so in 1981 he and a photographic assistant, Christopher Makos, agreed to collaborate on a session portraying Warhol in drag. In many ways, they modeled the series on Man Ray's 1920s work with the French artist Marcel Duchamp, in which the two artists created a female alter ego name Rrose Slavy for Duchamp.Warhol and Makos made a number of pictures, both black-and-white prints and color Polaroids, of their first attempt. For the second round of pictures, they hired a theater makeup person. This stage professional better understood the challenge of transforming a man's face into that of a woman. After the makeup, Warhol tried on curled, straight, long, short, dark, and blonde wigs. Here he appears in a conventionally masculine white shirt and plaid tie.","15 1 8 x 21 1 8 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Virgin and Child, St. Anne and Infant St. John","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10674801.jpg","Frederick Sommer","79.PA.151"
"1909","In Andy Warhol's depiction of his old friend Robert Rauschenberg as the wounded artist, the gauze and bandages add layers to the portrait in a way similar to Rauschenberg's own layered working methods. He and Warhol met in 1960 and two years later got together at Warhol's studio in a session that provided inspiration for both artists. Rauschenberg discovered the silkscreen process that Warhol was already using to transfer photographic images to canvas, and Warhol decided to do a series of paintings based on family snapshots of Rauschenberg, taking him as his first non-celebrity Pop subject. Through large canvases that repeated his portrait as many as twenty-five times, Warhol made Rauschenberg's face famous.A passion for photographs, including those they made themselves, was at the center of artmaking for both Warhol and Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg's confidence in photographs as major gallery pieces may have reassured Warhol that he should begin exhibiting some of the hundreds of photographs he had made in documenting his own life.","21 x 14 1 4 in.","Gelatin silver print","American","Three Graces","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10675801.jpg","Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida","79.PA.155"

And I mean, just getting to Christie Street must have taken an hour. He told me his assistant painted it.Thus Andy Warhol described his first impressions of Jean-Michel Basquiat. Warhol made this portrait in the fall of 1982, when he was first formally introduced to the newly famous twenty-one-year-old painter. Warhol was one of Basquiat's heroes; the young star, in turn, represented for Warhol the creative sexual energy of the 1960s. The two prolific artists carried on an intense friendship in the mid-eighties, culminating in an artistic collaboration. Basquiat died of a drug overdose before he was twenty-eight, fulfilling his belief that  the true path to creativity is to burn out.

Andy Warhol made Haring's acquaintance in 1982.Haring attributed his simple graphic style, which Warhol praised as  cartoonist,  to the hallucinatory power of drugs. Warhol made his Polaroids of Haring, seen here on the left, and his partner Juan Dubose, in preparation for several forty by forty-inch painted portraits, one executed in black and white. The camera's flash and studio lighting created strong shadows that haunt the figures. Warhol helped his young friends deal with problems caused by their early success, but portraits such as this--heavy with memorial overtones--suggest that he was also prescient about their early deaths.","15 1 16 x 21 3 8 in.","Oil on canvas","Swiss","Hall of the Ambassadors, Alhambra, Granada","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00081001.jpg","Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida","84.XT.1582.1"

After he settled at the Chelsea Hotel, where segments of Warhol's film were shot, he began making photographs, often self-portraits or portraits of his roommate, the poet Patti Smith, and usually with a borrowed Polaroid camera.Mapplethorpe's maturing approach to photography resembled Warhol's in many ways. He had no patience for the technical side of the medium and prided himself on gaining a reputation without ever having made a print himself. Portraiture was his main theme, and he used the camera as a means of making connections with celebrities, potential patrons, and possible lovers. In the 1980s, sales of Mapplethorpe's pictures soared. Warhol was commissioned to paint his portrait, so Mapplethorpe sat for the preparatory Polaroids, including this one. In turn, Warhol sat for Mapplethorpe in 1986.","6 1 2 x 8 1 2 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish and French","Pepilla the Gypsy and Her Daughter","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00074901.jpg","Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida","84.XT.837.3"

Her very fast life had been filled with yachts, discotheques, costly resorts, designer clothes, an early marriage to an older man, and a fairly swift divorce. As the oldest of the prince's three children, she had served as  first lady  of Monaco since her mother's tragic death in an automobile accident the previous fall. Andy Warhol portrayed her in the same aloof style that had been her mother's hallmark.Warhol considered royalty another element of the Pop scene. His representations of Princess Caroline, however, were more in the tradition of Hollywood studio photographers than that of court painters. Warhol posed Caroline in profile, as if he were photographing a legendary star, with her long, soft, wavy hair hanging loose on her bare neck. The lighting on her face cast a deep shadow, creating strong chiaroscuro in 1940s film noir style; along with her downward gaze, the lighting made her appear remote and imperious.","9 3 16 x 14 5 8 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish","Court of the Dances, Alczar, Sevilla","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00080701.jpg","Joaqun Sorolla y Bastida","99.DE.45"

She had also gained celebrity status for her individual style. Her six-foot height, striking features, dramatic makeup, and love of men's clothing created attention as well as confusion; was she a man in drag, a woman who had been a man, or the product of a plastic surgeon Voguemagazine commissioned Warhol to photograph Jones in July 1984. He waited three hours before an assistant discovered that Jones was at a department store retrieving one of her furs from storage. According to Warhol, who thought jewelry a much better investment, Jones spent  all her money on fur coats.  It is not surprising, then, that he portrayed her in one during this session.","10 9 16 x 12 7 8 in.","Oil on canvas","Flemish","Corner of the Garden, Alcazar, Sevilla","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00081101.jpg","Southworth & Hawes","MS. 37"

By positioning the camera so that the base of the slender tree appears to grow from the bottom edge of the picture, Watkins composed the photograph so that the canyon rim and the open space beyond it seem to intersect. Although he sacrificed the top of the tree, he was able to place the miniaturized Yosemite Falls at the visual center of the picture. To alleviate the monotony of an empty sky, he added the clouds from a second negative.  This image was taken while Watkins was working for the California Geological Survey.

"1919, print 1923 - 1939","It was [Jean-Antoine Watteau's] habit to make his drawings in a bound book, so that he always had a large supply of them at hand. When he was in the mood to paint a picture, he resorted to his collection of drawings and chose the figures most suited for the occasion.Just as this early biographer described, Watteau made this drawing as a study of women's costumes and movement. The central figure later appeared in his painting,Embarkation for Cythera, a diploma piece that gained him membership in theAcadmie Royalein 1717; the right figure appeared in another painting.Watteau may have first learned the three-colored chalk technique calledtrois crayonsby studying Peter Paul Rubens's drawings. This example shows his mastery of the technique and of composition. Watteau achieved brilliant color effects not only through the sensitivity of his line but also by setting down each chalk separately, rather than mixing the three colors. Although each figure is a separate study, Watteau arranged the three elements to create a pleasing, balanced composition.","16 3 4 x 7 1 16 in.","Platinum print","American","Portrait - New York","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06191701.jpg","Paul Strand","86.XM.686.1"

"1923","Using a delicate pattern of red chalk lines to illustrate the play of light on the folds of the woman's silk dress, Jean-Antoine Watteau portrayed an elegant young woman in an unself-conscious pose. Black chalk strokes accentuate elements of emphasis: the closed fan in her hands, the outline of the edges of her dress, and the deep shadow behind her. White lines add areas of highlights. Watteau particularly favored the effects of  combining three colors of chalk, red, black and white, a technique known astrois crayons.Watteau probably sketched the figure as a life study, not in preparation for a particular painting. Later, when he required a particular gesture or movement for one of his paintings, he would have referred back to this drawing.

In this image, a drunk woman confronts two High Society women who are attending the opera. Mrs. George Washington Kavanaugh and Lady Decies appear nonplussed to be in close proximity to the disheveled woman.

His elevated and diagonal angle exploited the formal qualities of Modotti's curvaceous figure.Modotti was not simply Weston's lover and model; she exerted an enormous influence on his creative vision during their years together in Mexico.

"1654","Edward Weston was fascinated with Mexico's stirring sky, which he found to be far more inspiring than Southern California's blue expanses. Writing in his daybook, he expressed his concern:  Clouds have been tempting me again. Next to the recording of a fugitive expression, or revealing the pathology of some human being, is there anything more elusive than cloud forms!  The sky changed so rapidly in Mexico that Weston bemoaned the difficulty of making a two-second exposure. Throughout the three-year period that he spent in Mexico, from 1923 to 1926, Weston repeatedly photographed the restless clouds sweeping overhead.","","Brush and brown ink","French","A Wooded Landscape","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00042601.jpg","Herman van Swanevelt","85.XM.11.2"

Bored with portraiture, Weston began to experiment with the symbolic and formal potential of objects he found. By nesting one chambered nautilus shell inside another, he created a powerful sinuous form not seen in nature. The polished surface of the shells reflects the light, interrupting the sensual curve with piercing highlights. The shells stand in bold relief against the stark black background.","","Pen and brown ink, brownwash, and black chalk","French","Woodland Landscape with Nymphs and Satyrs","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10865601.jpg","Michael Sweerts","85.XM.11.31"

The way in which Weston composed this picture further emphasizes its rhythmic patterns. Weston chose the right time of day and printed the photograph with high contrast to create alternating, horizontal bands of light and dark.After joining a photographic unit of the Signal Corps during World War II, Weston was sent to New York City to study photography. But his already-considerable skill enabled him to complete assignments quickly, leaving time to pursue his own photographic interests. In his free time, Weston wandered the city with a cumbersome 8-by-10-inch camera and made images such as this, in which the literal and the abstract coexist.

"1839","Brett Weston saw something interesting in the most commonplace subjects, which he often transformed into abstract arrangements of pattern and texture in his prints. By moving in close to eliminate context, Weston de-emphasized the cultural significance of his often-humble subjects.Here, Weston played with the viewer's sense of three-dimensional space by focusing on a window with lace curtains and potted plants, and the reflection of a building from across the street. He positioned the camera in such a way that the flowers embroidered on the curtain appear to be sprouting from the pots sitting on the window's ledge.The reflection of the photographer's camera is seen in the lower right hand corner-a dark shape with rounded corners and a tripod leg that appears to jut from the plant container on the far right.The scene is easily recognizable, but it takes a moment to understand the relationship between the various parts.

Her sumptuous attire, heavily woven with gold thread, and her jeweled fingers and headdress reflect her aristocratic status. Oddly, the artist did not match the patterns of the sleeves, as would have been customary during this period.In fact, the duchess never actually sat for this portrait, which may account for the misunderstood representation of her clothing. Scholars believe that the artist copied Isabella's likeness from a lost portrait by Rogier van der Weyden. The tender, slightly mocking expression on the duchess's face and the elongated fingers reflect van der Weyden's concept of portraiture.The prominent inscription in the upper left corner of the panel,PERSICA SIBYLLA IA,suggests that the portrait was part of a series depicting sibyls. This identity strikingly contrasts with Duchess Isabella's costume.

In his right hand he once held atrident, now missing, while in his left he holds a conch shell. The artist, probably Benedikt Wurzelbauer, suggests the nude figure's great strength through the carefully articulated muscles on his chest and the veins on his arms. The figure leans his weight on his back leg, arching his back slightly as if fighting the wind that blows his hair and beard. His upraised arms, the twist of his right wrist, and the position of his feet recall dance poses. The high gloss on the bronze and the slight twist in the torso bring out a shimmering play of light on the metallic surface. In contrast to Italian practice, Germanfoundriesof this period frequently used wood rather thanterracottaor wax models. The rigid treatment of this figure's details, together with its stiff pose and the planar handling of its surfaces, suggests that it was cast from a carved wood model.","","Duotone solarized gelatin silver print","German","Cactus, Taliesin West, Scottsdale, Arizona","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10682301.jpg","Edmund Teske","2001.87.15"

Beginning in the mid-1400s, prints and engravings were widely available and were frequently adapted by artists to fit the circular shapes of ceramics. Xanto probably transferred the image by pricking the print with small holes, placing thecartoonagainst the ceramic surface, and then rubbing a dark powder on it, which would copy the lines of the image onto the plate when it passed through the holes.The back of the plate is inscribed in blue with the date, the artist's signature, and a verse describing the mythological scene on the front.","","Duotone solarized gelatin silver print","German","Olive Hill, Hollywood","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10599901.jpg","Edmund Teske","84.GA.51"

"1970","This sculpture representing a ram's skull and horn is at once realistic and abstract. Composed of two parts, one form twists and curves upward, suggesting the distinct, massive horn of a ram. The second, more compact form evokes the long-faced shape of the skull. Its indentations suggest the hollow space of the eye sockets and mouth. But each part also clearly departs from a naturalistic depiction. In fact, it is not the forms themselves but their varied surfaces--furrowed and grained or smooth and polished--that most acutely conjure up a craggy, decaying skeleton. It is as if we have stumbled upon some slightly unfamiliar archeological find.Jack Zajac's inspiration to sculpt a ram's skull came from casually squeezing balls of wax into shapes he found appealing. According to the artist, he noticed a striking resemblance to an animal's skull in the wax's contours. Zajac then elaborated this form into a more immediately recognizable image. TheRam's Skullseries is comprised of fourteen unique sculptures. Several of the sculptures, like this one, are made up of two discrete parts. The decision to separate the skull and horn arose when a plaster Zajac was working on broke in two and he appreciated the effect of this  accident. Zajac builds his plaster models by hand and carves directly into the surface using hand-axes and chisels. The bronze is then cast from the plaster. Here, the metal's rough-hewn surface accurately reflects the rugged contours of the plaster's exterior.","","Gelatin silver composite print","Greek","Facade, Chicago, Composite with Shirley Berman","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13743301.jpg","Edmund Teske","86.XM.643.1"

Life drawing was the basis of instruction at the Accademia, so the subject was appropriate for this drawing, the basis for an engravedfrontispieceto Zanotti'sStoria dell'Accademia Clementina di Bolognaof 1739.Zanotti began by sketching with black chalk, then went over those lines with pen and ink. His thought process is evident in the chalk underdrawing of the lamp and its rope, which he initially drew farther to the left. Zanotti, who probably also made the engraving, went over the principal outlines with the stylus to transfer the design to the copperplate for engraving.","","Gelatin silver print","Greek","George Herms, Topanga Canyon","www.getty.edu art collections images l 13744301.jpg","Edmund Teske","96.AE.96"

The frieze-like arrangement to the figures, their sculptural character indicated by extensive white heightening, and the vantage point from below indicate that this was a design for a facade painting. Although Taddeo Zuccaro was famous for them during his early career, most of his work in this medium has now been lost. This drawing may relate to his best known faade painting and first independent project in the Palazzo Mattei in Rome, completed in 1548. In this masterful drawing Zuccaro used the blue paper that artists in Venice so often favored. The blue served as a middle tone, with the outlines and shadows drawn in black chalk and the shining highlights of flesh, armor, and drapery added in white.

A large bearded head, possibly Neptune, gazes up from the bottom of the bowl as if from the ocean's depths, only making himself known as the vessel's contents are emptied. Here Zuccaro explored the problem of accommodating active figures within a circular frame. The reclining female figure at the top shares certain features with the sibyl on the verso. In exploring his ideas, Zuccaro flipped the paper over, proceeding naturally from one project to the other. Whether completely spontaneous or more finished, energy and expressiveness characterize his line.The studies on the verso are connected with decorations that Zuccaro completed in a Roman chapel in 1556. Despite their sketchy appearance, he probably drew them at a late stage in the design process because they correspond closely to figures in the fresco. The female figures served as studies for a sibyl in the round lunette above the altar.","","Terracotta","French","Fragmentary Mug with a Youth Drinking from a Wine Cup","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00861701.jpg","Theseus Painter","86.DF.521"

The saint lies prostrate on the ground while one servant tends to him and another flees the scene in terror, shielding his eyes from the piercing light as he runs. His horse, too, has fallen down and clambers awkwardly to its feet. Paul had been on the road to Damascus to obtain authorization from the synagogue to arrest Christians when he was suddenly struck by the brilliant light and converted to Christianity. The artist sketched the figures first with black chalk, then went over their outline in brown ink. Fine strokes of lead white heightening create the textures of muscles and fabrics while providing a delicate contrast to the blue tone of the paper. Zuccaro drew this preparatory study for the lower section of a now much-damaged altarpiece in a chapel in Rome.

Zuccaro drew an event that took place in 1177, more than four hundred years earlier. Emperor Frederick I, nicknamed  Barbarossa  or  Red Beard  by the Italians, had tried to invade Italy and set up his own pope, which led Pope Alexander to excommunicate him. Frederick withdrew temporarily but then returned, captured Rome, and was in the midst of preparing further attacks when his army was destroyed by disease.

The drawings vividly convey a sense of the artist's material and intellectual life in Renaissance Rome. Details of studio practice join depictions of precise locations, monuments, and antiquities and references to the great artistic personalities of the Renaissance, including Michelangelo and Raphael. Scholars believe that the shape of the drawings shows that they were studies for decorative ceiling panels. Because so many of the sheets contain images of Rome, they may have been intended for frescoes in the Palazzo Zuccari in Rome. In Federico's will of 1603, he left his palazzo to the Accademia di San Luca so that it could be used as a hostel for poor, young artists coming to study in the capital. The imagery of Taddeo's early struggles would have been an appropriate reminder for the students at the beginning of their careers.","","Gilt andpatinatedbronze; enameled metal;vert Maurin des Alpesmarble; white marble","Italian","Mantel Clock","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00658101.jpg","Pierre-Philippe Thomire","96.GB.318"

"1785","The biographer and painter Giorgio Vasari noted that Taddeo Zuccaro drew  particularly the works by the hand of Raphael that were in the house of Agostino Chigi [the Villa Farnesina] and in other places in Rome. And since very often, when the evening came on, he had no other place wherein to sleep, many a night he took refuge under the loggia of the above-named Chigi's house and in other suchlike places.  Under the light of a crescent moon, Taddeo carefully copies Raphael's frescoes in the arches of the loggia above. Like other young artists of his day, he was eager to educate himself by copying the modern masters. Federico Zuccaro so carefully reproduced these designs that scholars can identify the scenes asJupiter and CupidandPsyche Reaching the Palace of Venus.At left, Taddeo lies exhausted, having fallen asleep while drawing.","","Pen and brown ink and brownwash","Italian","View of a Villa","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00014301.jpg","Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo","78.DA.99"
"1791","Federico Zuccaro described this scene in his notes:  One should not keep quiet to what happened to [Taddeo Zuccaro] during his return: tired of walking and suffering from fever, he stopped on the banks of a river, and waiting for someone to take him across, he rested and fell asleep; he woke up all sick from the pain he had and looking at the bank of the river, the stone and the gravel seemed as painted and historiated, similar to the facade and works of Polidoro [da Caravaggio] that he saw in Rome; this pleased him greatly. So shaken was his mind, and with the imagination he had, he really believed these to be what they seemed to be. He began his search for the stones that seemed better and more beautiful; he filled a sack, in which he carried his small things and his drawings.  In a continuous narrative, Federico represented his brother four times. Taddeo falls asleep by a stream on the left and dreams in a circle above his head. In his illness he awakens to a hallucination that the river stones are painted with figures by Polidoro. He then loads his sack with these precious objects and struggles onwards.","","Pen and brown ink, brownwashover black chalk","Italian","A Centaur and a Female Faun in a Landscape","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14600901.jpg","Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo","84.AE.745"
"1750 - 1760","This story in three scenes moves from right to left. First Taddeo Zuccaro returns home, slack-mouthed with exhaustion, carrying the heavy sack of stones he gathered on his back. As biographer Giorgio Vasari explained, Taddeo  carried them home and gave them to his mother, telling her they were even more precious than himself.  In the center, Taddeo's parents welcome the young man warmly as he deliriously points to his heavy bag. On the left, he lies in bed, watched over by his parents and his little brother, the artist Federico Zuccaro. A large carved wooden bed with a canopy nearly fills the room. Several paintings and a frescoed  cornice on the far wall and a fireplace projecting from the hidden wall form the other handsome furnishings.","","Pen and brown and gray ink, brush with brown and gray wash, over black chalk","French","Christ at Supper with Simon the Pharisee, with the Anointment of Christ's Feet by Mary Magdalen","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14449201.jpg","Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo","89.GB.72"
"1770 - 1775"," Taddeo [Zuccaro], at length, restored to health and once more in Rome, resumed his usual studies,  noted his contemporary, biographer and artist Giorgio Vasari. Here the young artist enters Rome through one of the city's gates. He stands on the threshold of the gate, holding the hands of figures representing Drawing and Spirit. The Three Graces stand nearby, waiting for them to enter.As in other drawings from this series, Federico Zuccaro included a detailed and accurate view of Rome from the city gate. The steps of the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo are just visible between Taddeo's legs, and the Arch of Marcus Aurelius, the Colonna Antonini, and the Campidoglio fill the background.","","Pen and brown ink, brown wash, and black chalk","French","Punchinello Is Helped to a Chair","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00006401.jpg","Jean-Baptiste Tilliard","2001.48"
"470 - 460","Having recovered from his illness, Taddeo Zuccaro returned to Rome to study both classical and contemporary works of art. He sits in the courtyard of the Vatican Belvedere, sketching theLaocon. Around him are theApollo Belvedereand the river gods of the Tiber and the Nile. An inkwell and pen box sit at his feet as he draws.The highlights of Roman architecture stretch out below Taddeo, including the papal apartments of the Vatican decorated by Raphael. Federico Zuccaro singled them out for notice with his label,le camere di Rafaello(Raphael's apartments). On the right is the new Saint Peter's basilica under construction. The left side of the courtyard was still open in the 1540s, but it was closed in later in the century.","","Two-tonedgildedbeechwood; modern silk upholstery","Italian","Bed (Lit  la Turque)","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00677801.jpg","Jacques-Jean-Baptiste Tilliard","2007.7"
"1549","Standing at the steps of the pope's throne in the Sistine Chapel, Taddeo Zuccaro sketches one of Michelangelo's masterpieces, theLast Judgement. At his feet Federico Zuccaro added his brother's inkwell, a pen box, and a bag. Taddeo appears older than in previous scenes, no longer a boy but a young man with leggings to his knees, a long-sleeved jacket, and a loose cap over his curls.","","Gilded beech and walnut; modern silk velvet upholstery","Italian","Four Armchairs and One Settee","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00637201.jpg","Timokrates Painter","2002.30"
"1590 - 1610","The series culminates with the largest and most elaborate scene, showing Taddeo Zuccaro decorating the facade of the Palazzo Mattei, the work that established his reputation when he was only eighteen years old. Biographer Giorgio Vasari explained that when Taddeo returned to Rome, his cousin Francesco il Sant'Angelo sought him out and they began to work together on many commissions. Francesco recommended him to a Roman nobleman, Jacopo Mattei, and suggested that Taddeo paint the first two subjects to prove his artistic talent when Mattei thought the artist too young. Taddeo sits precariously on a scaffolding painting the facade, with two allegories of Fame flying above. The Three Graces stand around him with Allegories of Spirit and Pride. Although the frescoes are still unfinished in the drawing, the most famous painters in Rome already flock to see them. Michelangelo arrives on horseback with his servant and two of his followers, and Vasari is deep in conversation with Francesco Salviati on the far right. Completed in 1548, the facade was hailed as a masterpiece by the leading artists in Rome, and it cemented the young Taddeo's reputation.","","Terracotta","Italian","Oil Jar with a Woman Carrying a Basket of Offerings","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01286401.jpg","Jacopo Tintoretto","2003.486"
"1866","Allegorical figures of Study and Intelligence sit on either side of the Zuccaro family's symbol of a sugar loaf sprouting lilies, a play on the Italian wordzucchero,meaning sugar. The figure of Study is hard at work drawing a nude torso, surrounded by a rooster and various other sculptures. Intelligence, on the right, holds a caduceus in his right hand, while an elephant peers out beside him.The drawing's irregular shape and viewpoint suggest to scholars that it was intended for a ceiling decoration.","","Black chalk with white chalkhighlights","Italian","Studies of a Statuette of Atlas and a Figure Praying","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00029901.jpg","Domenico Tintoretto","87.GB.35"
"1873","In the center of the canvas,Cupid, the god of love, subdues the godPanby grabbing one of his ears. Pan personifies carnal lust, so their struggle represents the combat of divine and earthly love. The subject comes from a popular quotation from the Roman poetVirgil:  Love conquers all.  The scene is set inArcadia, a romantic paradise inhabited bynymphsand shepherds. Around Cupid and Pan, various figures gesture as they watch the two gods struggle. A wingedallegoricalfigure soars above, catching the attention of several figures below.This scene may derive from the central vault of the Sala d'Ercole (Room ofHercules) in the Villa Farnese at Caprarola, which was painted by Federico Zuccaro.","","Black chalk heightened with white chalk","Italian","Studies of a Reclining Female Nude","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14054101.jpg","Jacques Joseph Tissot","56.PA.1"
"1533","Using red chalk in a highly detailed manner, Federico Zuccaro depicted Saint Peter's Square in Rome as it appeared in 1603, with the Egyptian obelisk in place at the extreme left and the church dome complete. At the left, the archepiscopal palace adjoins the old facade of Saint Peter's basilica. In the center, the three-story benediction loggia begun by Pope Pius II in 1462 adjoins the loggia painted by Raphael, lightly sketched at the extreme right. The bastion for the papal guard protects the front of the Vatican entrance, and statues of saints Peter and Paul from the 1400s adorn the foot of the staircase.On the verso, Zuccaro drew a young boy with great intimacy, using the same medium--black and red chalk--and the same delicacy of touch seen in his other late portrait studies. Zuccaro's use of color was innovative: scholars recognize him as the first Italian of his time to combine black with red chalk, a technique practiced earlier by Hans Holbein.","","Oil on canvas","Greek","Portrait of the Marquise de Miramon, ne, Thrse Feuillant","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30344801.jpg","Jacques Joseph Tissot","92.PA.42"
"1555 - 1556","Humans and animals co-exist peacefully in this lush, fantastical setting. In the foreground, graceful nude figures lounge or pose elegantly like statues, while two small boys urinate into a stream that flows into a small pool. In the background, figures dance in a circle; high above in the distance, others sit on a hill and watch wild animals at play.Jacopo Zucchi made this highly finished compositional study, or modello, for the small scale paintingThe Age of Gold, now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. The Golden Age, the first of four ages of the world in classical mythology, followed immediately after the world's creation and was an earthly paradise akin to the Christian Garden of Eden.","","Brush withgouacheand watercolor, over graphite on brown wove laid paper","French","Young Woman in a Rocking Chair, study for the painting The Last Evening","www.getty.edu art collections images l 14520301.jpg","Titian","85.GG.98"
