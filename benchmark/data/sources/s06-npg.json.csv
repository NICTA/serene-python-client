"National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of Henry Merriam Abbot, in loving memory of his great-grandfather, Henry Larcom Abbot","Born Wapakoneta, Ohio   On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon, meeting President John F. Kennedys 1961 goal for Americans to reach the moon by the end of the decade. Descending from the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) to the lunar surface, Armstrong declared, One small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind as a camera beamed images back to earth. The lunar landing-during which Armstrong had to override the LEMs autopilot to manually guide the aircraft to a safe landing on the moon-represents a defining moment in Armstrongs distinguished career, which included service in the Korean War. In honor of his achievement, the nation recognized him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969; he also received many other national and international accolades. He went on to teach and to work in private industry and helped the nation continue to strengthen its space program.","Henry Larcom Abbot","http:  npgportraits.si.edu eMuseumNPG media previews 9200254a.jpg","13 Aug 1831 - 1 Oct 1927","1823 - 1888","1992-05-26","1857","2010 Laurie H.

"National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; transfer from the National Museum of Natural History","When Vice President Chester Arthur succeeded to the presidency on the death of James Garfield, a newspaper noted that he was  not a man who would have entered anybody's mind  as a worthy candidate for the office. Indeed, as a major player in a spoils system that reduced the civil service to a vehicle for rewarding party faithful, he struck many as an emblem of all that was wrong in American politics. As president, however, Arthur rose above his past to promote landmark legislation designed to curb the spoils system. He also proved to be a foe of other forms of corruption. When, for example, a  pork barrel  bill for public improvements reached his desk, he vetoed it.  This head-and-shoulders portrait can only hint at the fashionable figure that Arthur cut. With his muttonchop whiskers  trimmed to the perfection point  and his suits made of only the finest fabrics, he invariably looked like the very epitome of the well-bred Victorian gentleman.","Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz","http:  npgportraits.si.edu eMuseumNPG media previews 6600030a.jpg","28 May 1807 - 14 Dec 1873","26 Nov 1869 - 1969","1966","1913"," Louis Glanzman","Jean Louis Rodolphe Agassiz","National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution","88.9cm x 76.2cm (35  x 30 ), Accurate","None","NPG.66.15","Louis Mayer","Oil on canvas","Facial Hair","Painting","None"

"Union League Club, New York","The most brilliant scientist of the twentieth century, physicist Albert Einstein inspires comparisons to Isaac Newton. By the time he reached thirty, his theory of relativity and work in quantum mechanics had revolutionized physics and profoundly altered our perception of the world. Einstein naturally commanded great prestige in the United States when he sought refuge from the Nazi regime of his native Germany in 1933. His words thus carried enormous weight in 1939 when he wrote a letter alerting President Roosevelt that Germany was moving toward the development of nuclear weaponry. Eventually, that warning gave impetus to the Manhattan Project, the top-secret venture that in 1945 produced the world's first atomic bomb. While sitting for this likeness in 1944, Einstein mused to his portraitist,  After fifty years they will say of me, either he was a great man or a fool!

Adhering to his  dymaxion  principle, which called for maximum results from a minimum of material and energy, he was an early advocate of prefabrication and modular construction. The most famous of Fuller's achievements was the geodesic dome, which artist Boris Artzybasheff wittily depicts here as the structure of Fuller's face and skull. Patented in 1947, this spherical structure required no internal support, thus creating an unobstructed interior space.

"National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of Jon R. Friedman","Herbert Hoover seemed to be the ultimate problem-solver. As a mining engineer, he had turned marginal operations into thriving enterprises. During World War I, his administration of European food relief was nothing short of brilliant. As secretary of commerce in the 1920s, he transformed a once-sleepy department into a purposeful information clearinghouse. But as the Great Depression took hold during the second year of his presidency, Hoover was hard pressed for a solution. Believing in the power of private initiative, he hesitated to involve the federal government in reviving business. When lengthening bread lines and escalating joblessness finally convinced him of the necessity of such steps, the measures proved inadequate. As a result, Hoover was defeated by a crushing margin in his 1932 reelection bid. This portrait was intended for Time magazine's cover. But Hoover delayed his sittings, and by the time it was finished, the magazine was no longer interested.

Jefferson appears younger than his fifty years, perhaps evoking the young man the artist remembered as the Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress. Jefferson was well known to Americans in 1791, having also served as governor of Virginia and ambassador to France. Notwithstanding George Washington's desire for unity in his administration, Jefferson quickly found himself at odds with Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, whose power and influence on the president rivaled his own. Jefferson favored a smaller, weaker national government, with more power residing in the states, and closer ties to France; Hamilton argued for a powerful national government allied to Great Britain.

"National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of Time magazine","On his epitaph, Thomas Jefferson indicated his authorship of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and his founding of the University of Virginia. He omitted, however, any mention of being the third president of the United States, perhaps because his policies failed to end encroachments on American rights during the Napoleonic Wars of the early 1800s. Great Britain, with its naval superiority, forbade American ships from supplying Napoleons armies and forced American sailors to serve in its navy (impressment). After failing to change British policy with a Non-Importation Act (1806), Congress passed Jeffersons Embargo Act (1807), prohibiting American ships and goods from leaving port. In the final month of his presidency, Jefferson repealed the embargo and signed the Non-Intercourse Act, which reopened trade with all nations except Great Britain and France. It also authorized his successor, James Madison, to resume trade with whichever of those nations stopped violating American neutral trading rights.","David Baltimore","http:  npgportraits.si.edu eMuseumNPG media previews 78t0518a.jpg","born 7 Mar 1938","born 1935","1978-05","1977"," ","Harold Brown","National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution","81.6cm x 63.5cm (32 1 8  x 25 ), Accurate","None","NPG.78.TC260","Roy Andersen","Oil on canvas","Chair","Painting","None"

"National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; gift of Mrs. Philip Burt Fisher","Territorial expansion generated a spirit of technological adventure and a search for new methods to handle the unique conditions of American life. Cyrus McCormick, a farmer in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, succeeded where his father had failed by constructing the first practical reaping machine. This reaper was a first step in the mechanization of American agriculture, allowing the efficient cultivation of large tracts of farmland by small numbers of farmers.

McCormick's design was pirated by competitors, but he overcame his rivals by founding his own factory outside Chicago in 1847.

But around 1832 he became fascinated with the idea of sending messages via electric wire. With no scientific or mechanical training, Morse devised an elegant machine that sent coded messages by opening and closing an electrical circuit. While the government neglected the telegraph, private businesses seized on the new invention as a great leap forward in communications technology. At a time when railways and water transportation were binding the country together, Morse did the same with a network of instantaneous communication.

Everyone, it seemed, wanted the hero's portrait. But it is this portrait that stands for all time as the image that best represents what Washington meant to us when we were a new nation and continues to mean to us in the twenty-first century. It is the one picture that we can say ranks in importance with those sacred founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.  We see Washington in 1796, the last year of his two-term presidency. Earlier full-length portraits show him in military uniform, but here he is in civilian dress, revealing that in our democracy the elected executive is the true commander-in-chief. Standing in elegant surroundings suggesting the grandeur of European tradition, Washington is nonetheless not draped like a king, which he refused to be; he is a man powerful only by the people's consent. This was the man who told us what this new kind of leader-an elected president-could be and whose maturity and resolve gave us confidence in our future. The rainbow behind him breaks through a stormy sky.  Washington was lucky in his portraitist, and so are we. American-born Gilbert Stuart had eighteen years in Europe to hone his artistry. He was commissioned by Senator and Mrs. William Bingham of Pennsylvania to provide a gift to the Marquis of Lansdowne, an English supporter of American independence.

Martha Washington convinced the president to sit again because, according to artist Rembrandt Peale, she  wished a Portrait for herself; he therefore consented on the express condition that when finished it should be hers.  Stuart, however, preferred this portrait to his earlier Washington; he purposely left it and that of the first lady unfinished so that he could use this as a model for the numerous copies that the first president's admirers commissioned. After Stuart's death, the two paintings were purchased for the Boston Athenaeum, which owned them for more than 150 years.  This image served as the basis for the engraving of Washington on the one-dollar bill.
