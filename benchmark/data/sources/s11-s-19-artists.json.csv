"b. 1552 Cologne, Germany, d. 1615 Prague, Czech Republic","Painter","Hans von Aachen","Hans von Aachen's renowned cosmopolitanManneriststyle originated humbly: he first trained with a minor painter in his native Cologne, and he took his name from his father's hometown. He probably joined the Cologne painters'guildbefore leaving for Italy around 1574.After a stay in Venice, von Aachen was soon in Rome, learning from a circle of Northern European artists. He also painted portraits in Florence. Back in Germany by 1587, he began to gain fame for history pictures and psychologically sensitive portraits.In 1592 Emperor Rudolf II of Prague named Von Aachen imperial painterin absentia. Four years later he moved to Prague, serving as painter, art dealer, and diplomat while also completing commissions for clients in Munich and Augsburg. He frequently journeyed abroad on diplomatic missions and to purchase pictures for his insatiable patron. After Rudolf's death in 1612, von Aachen worked for his successor, Emperor Matthias.Von Aachen's Prague paintings reflect Rudolf's desire for sensuality, with smoothly modeled, elongated figures arranged in elegant poses, often including a nude woman seen from behind. His style combined an idealization indebted to Roman and Florentine Mannerism with brilliant Venetian color and Dutch realism. The many engravings published after his designs spread von Aachen's influence.","German"

She learned photography in the 1920s in Paris, as a studio assistant of fellow American expatriate Man Ray. She soon opened her own portrait studio, where she photographed artists and intellectuals living in Paris, including James Joyce and Eugne Atget. After Atget's death, Abbott was instrumental in promoting his work by preserving his prints and negatives and arranging for publications and exhibitions of his photographs. She returned to the United States and began to photograph the architectural landscape of New York City, which resulted in the publicationChanging New York.

"b. May 8,  1937 Orange, New Jersey","photographer","Robert Adams","Robert Adams has photographed the landscape of the American West for more than forty years, particularly in California, Colorado and Oregon. His vision is inspired by his joy in nature's inherent beauty, yet tempered by his dismay at its exploitation and degradation. Adams uses photography to express his love for the landscape and to understand how urban and industrial growth have changed it, all the while insisting that beauty in the world has not been entirely eclipsed.Adams was born in New Jersey in 1937 and raised in the suburbs of Denver, Colorado. He moved to Southern California in 1956 to attend the University of Redlands. He chose to major in English literature and went on to earn a Ph.D. in that subject at the University of Southern California in 1965.When Adams returned to Colorado to begin what he anticipated would be a career in teaching, he was dismayed by the changes he saw in the landscape. He bought a 35-mm camera, taught himself the fundamentals of photography, and began making pictures infused with a love for the geography of his home state.Adams's visual education came in part through the work of photographers who had preceded him in the West a century before, especially those of Timothy O'Sullivan, William Henry Jackson, and Carleton Watkins. Their work, together with that of Lewis Hine, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange, and Ansel Adams--who often merged their social concerns with aesthetic ones--helped inspire Adams's style: a spare formalism coupled with emotional depth.Since the 1970s, more than twenty-five books of Adams's photographs have been published, as well as two collections of essays,Beauty in Photography: Essays in Defense of Traditional Values(1989) andWhy People Photograph(1994).","American"
"b.  1917 Far Cotton, Northamptonshire, d.   1984 Great Maplestead, Essex","sculptor; designer","Robert Adams","In the years following World War II, Robert Adams was among a handful of English sculptors who fully embraced three-dimensional abstraction. Unlike Henry Moore or Barbara Hepworth, whose work always related to the human figure or natural landscape, Adams freed his forms from the world around him and explored the pure interplay of angular and circular objects in space.In the 1930s and early 1940s, Adams supported himself with a variety of jobs and was only able to study art intermittently. But after World War II, during which he served as an engineer, he was able to commit to a career as a sculptor. At the age of thirty in 1947, Adams held his first one-man show. Under the influence of Henry Moore, he showed wood, plaster, and stone forms abstracted from the natural world. Trips to Europe and America over the next few years exposed Adams to a range of influences and he broke away from his English contemporaries to create increasingly abstract forms. In Paris, Adams befriended Constantin Brancusi and studied work by Pablo Picasso and Kazimir Malevich. In New York, Adams met a number of American artists including Alexander Calder.Much of Adams' early work was carved wood or stone. But in the mid-1950s, after learning to weld, he increasingly turned to iron, bronze, and, for large architectural reliefs, poured concrete. During the 1960s, he worked primarily with welded steel sheets. Sometimes these forms were pierced allowing light to shine through. Now one of Britain's preeminent abstract sculptors, Adams received commissions for large works across Europe and America. He suddenly abandoned welded steel at the end of the 1960s and returned to carving. Many of his later sculptures are modest bronzes from carved wood patterns, although he did continue to create some large pieces in stainless steel.","British"

The Society was an eclectic group of intellectuals with a wide variety of interests; at its meetings, Adamson learned of the invention of photography from Sir David Brewster. Brewster, the newly appointed principal of the St. Andrews colleges, had learned about photography through correspondence with one of its inventors, William Henry Fox Talbot. Some of the first photographs made in England were exhibited at the Society's meetings.Adamson primarily made portraits and views of the countryside near his home; he was known fornaturalistic, lively renderings of his subjects. He also taught photography to his brother, Robert Adamson. Many of John Adamson's prints survive in the Getty Museum's Brewster Album, in which Brewster assembled early photographs made in England and Scotland between 1839 and 1850.","British"

His surviving vases suggest that he specialized in the decoration of large vessels. His work marks the transition from theArchaicto theClassicalstyle in Greek vase-painting. The Aegisthus Painter's fondness for crowded, multi-figured scenes carried over from the Archaic period, yet aspects of his drawing style, like the nose that forms a straight line with the forehead and the heavy chins, were characteristic of the new Classical style. As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Aegisthus Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work.

The Affecter may have learned his trade from the Amasis Painter, one of the leading artists of the preceding generation, but he quickly diverged from the conventional path in both his potting and painting. The Affecter's potting was technically excellent. Most of his surviving vases are amphorae, but he chose unusual, old-fashioned forms and then added variations. At a time when Athenian vase-painters stressed thenarrativecontent of their work, the Affecter appeared uninterested and focused on the purely decorative aspects. In fact, he may not have been working to suit Athenian taste. Almost all his surviving vases have been found inEtruria, and he may have been creating vases solely for the Etruscan market.As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Affecter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work.

The count recognized the growing taste for a French style in the decorative arts and hired artisans from the renowned Moustiers Manufactories in southern France. Many early Alcora designs were based on the work of French artists, including Jacques Callot and Jean Brain.Alcora specialized intin-glazedearthenware (faience) and produced tableware, plaques,medallions, figures, and portraitbusts. Supported and protected by the Bourbon monarchy, Alcora expanded rapidly and its ceramics were exported to France, Italy, Portugal, and the Americas. When the count died in 1742, the factory was passed to his son, Pedro Pablo, Ximnez de Urrea, Abarca de Bola. Under Pedro Pablo's leadership, the factory produced exuberant and colorfulRococovessels and began making creamware (made of pipe clay) andsoft-paste porcelain. Alcora flourished well into the 1800s, but as interest in Rococo styles waned, so did the factory's fortunes.","Spanish"

He first trained as a goldsmith and produced a large number of ornamental designs for ironwork during the early part of his career, including designs for sheaths of swords, daggers and domestic knives. Most of his career however, was devoted to making engravings of mythological and Biblical subjects such as theTwelve Labors ofHerculesand the Story of Adam and Eve.Stylistically Aldegrever's work reflects the influence of Albrecht Drer, whose work was widely known throughout Europe and whose monogram Aldegrever imitated. Unlike Drer and his followers who specialized in intricate line work, Aldegrever specialized in optical effects of light and shadow. Slim, elongated figures and agitated drapery further distinguish his work. Aldegrever produced almost 300 engravings between 1527 and 1555, nearly all on a miraculously small scale.","German"
"b.  1598 Bologna, Italy, d.   1654 Rome","draftsman; sculptor; architect","Alessandro Algardi","Initial training under the Bolognese Lodovico Carracci decisively influenced Alessandro Algardi's art: he never strayed far from the stylistic tendencies shared by many of the artists from Bologna. Exposure to the classically tempered realism of the Carracci school underpinned Algardi's style, which embodied both classicism and the High Baroque.After carving ivory and modeling figures and ornaments for Duke Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua, Algardi settled in Rome by 1625. For ten years, he restored ancient sculpture while becoming known for portrait busts that captured both inward character and details of appearance. In Rome, his constant interaction with ancient classical statuary influenced his own sculpture.Unlike most contemporary sculptors, Algardi was an accomplished draftsman and also worked as an architect. Association with artists such as Domenichino, Nicolas Poussin, and Pietro da Cortona greatly affected his draftsmanship. His surviving drawings primarily relate to his sculptural projects or designs for engravings.Algardi received his first major sculptural commission at age forty, the tomb of Pope Leo XI. His large, influential workshop included Domenico Guidi, Ercole Ferrata, Michel Anguier, and Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi. Copies of Algardi's sculptures spread throughout Europe, inspiring such artists as Edm Bouchardon.","Italian"

There he became one of the principal painters for the ruling family of Florence, theMedici. Allori was appointed director of the Florentine tapestry factory in the mid-1570s. His work, which displays the complicated twisting poses typical of FlorentineMannerism, influenced artistic developments in Tuscany for almost fifty years following his death.","Italian"

He joined the paintersguildthere in 1599, around the same time that he was named official painter toArchduke Albertand Archduchess Isabella, for whom he created landscape paintings, images of court festivities, and designs for at least one set of tapestries. Alsloot's most famous and lucrative commission was a series of paintings recording theOmmegang, a splendid court procession through Brussels in 1615, during which Isabella was made Queen of the Crossbowmen's Guild.Alsloot's surviving works are rare: some thirty paintings and a few drawings. In his landscapes, Alsloot drew inspiration from the forest of Soignes near Brussels. Landscape painting of the late 1500s and the wooded landscapes of Gillis van Coninxloo also influenced his work. Alsloot's own style displayed a refined handling of foliage with a tendency to include views of castles andabbeysfrom the forest of Soignes. His paintings are usually topographically accurate, making it possible to identify places that survive today. The artist Hendrick de Clerck regularly added brightly colored figures, which often clash with the landscapes' brown-green tonality, to Alsloot's paintings,.","Flemish"

With this success, he acquired three homes and several vineyards. He also worked for suchpatronsas Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Duke William of Bavaria. Chosen Regensburg's mayor in 1528, Altdorfer declined because he needed time to complete a gigantic painting for the duke.Altdorfer's formats ranged from postage-stamp-sized etchings to life-sized paintings. In addition to prints and paintings, he made colored-groundchiaroscurodrawings and designed stained-glass windows. Fantasy, brilliant colors, and dazzling light effects at sunset or dawn marked his paintings, which usually depicted landscape.The first landscape painter in the modern sense and the leading figure of the Danube School, Altdorfer introduced landscape as a theme of its own in art. Unlike most of his German contemporaries, he painted few portraits, preferring to focus on the virgin forest or to use it as a setting for both secular and religious subjects. With their gestures, facial expressions, and color distorted for dramatic and emotional ends, his figures complemented his landscapes, themselves alive with an unusual sense of character.","German"

He used patches of colored light and shade to shape forms, rather than conceiving painting as colored drawing.In the early 1510s, Jacopo Pontormo, Rosso Fiorentino, and Giorgio Vasari, (who later maliciously slandered Andrea for lacking creative fire) trained in Andrea's highly influential studio. His process of making a series of preparatory drawings before painting demonstrated his patient pursuit of perfection and became a pattern for later artists.In 1517 or 1518 he married a wealthy widow who had modeled for him for several years, both for portraits and for Madonnas. In the 1520s, he built a substantial house in Florence, and his style became more ideal and more polished.","Italian"

In the early 1900s, scholars distinguished four stylistically distinct but closely related groups of vases, assigning them the names Apollodoros, the Epidromos Painter, the Kleomelos Painter, and the Elpinikos Painter. Scholars were unsure, however, whether these four groups actually represented the work of four separate individuals or four different stages in the career of one man. The cup depicting the ThebanSphinxin the Getty Museum now provides evidence that one individual made all these vases.

With Campagna and then on his own, Tiziano contributed to large-scale public commissions in Venice, Padua, and Tuscany.For most of his life, however, Tiziano worked for one person, Giovanni Grimani, a distinguished church official known for his collection of antiquities and his patronage of artists. Tiziano restored Grimani's ancient statues and made many pieces for his patron's home. At the end of his life, Tiziano moved to Pisa to live in the household of Grimani's great-nephew. Living near the famous marble quarries of Massa-Carrara, Tiziano branched out from the bronze work in which he had made his reputation and worked as a stone sculptor until his death in 1606.","Italian"

"active: around 1840 Paris","Photographer","Atelier Hliographique","What is known about the Atelier Hliographique (sun-writing studio) has come down through history because of a label attached to adaguerreotypein the Getty Museum's collection. In 1849 that photograph earned a gold medal in a local competition at the Conservatoire des Arts et Mtiers (Conservatory of Arts and Letters), located a few blocks south of the Atelier's address at 13 boulevard St.-Martin in Paris. In the 1840s a good deal of direct sunlight was needed to make the exposures for photographs, so studios were usually located on the roofs of buildings. The Atelier Hliographique was located on the ground floor; therefore, it was probably not a photographic studio but a business that distributed and sold photographs, specializing in daguerreotype portraits.","French"

His fame I am persweded is founded on superior Merit because I have heard so many Noblemen of good Tast concur in ye same opinion of him.... As a young man, Auguste worked with several different goldsmiths but was never officially apprenticed. A special court order freed him from thisguildnecessity because he produced work for the king. He was one of the first Parisian goldsmiths to execute pieces in theNeoclassicalstyle. Hispatronsincluded royalty and aristocracy, both in France and abroad.

After his mother remarried a captain in the Dutch guards, the family left France for Amsterdam. Aved's exposure to Dutch art led to his development of the  psychological portrait.  This innovation signaled a shift away from the mythologizing style of contemporaries like Nicolas de Largillire.By the age of sixteen, Aved was traveling through the Netherlands drawing portraits at fairs. After short stints in the Amsterdam studios of French artists, he arrived in Paris at nineteen. Working in a fashionable portrait painter's studio, Aved met Maurice-Quentin de La Tour, Jean-Baptiste Perroneau, and Jean-tienne Liotard. Most important, he began a long, cherished friendship with Jean-Baptiste-Simon Chardin. Together they shared the goal of capturing  truth  rather than depicting surface appearances alone. Many of Aved's portraits were attributed to Chardin during the 1800s.As a Parisian, Aved became a successful and independent artist, a member of theAcadmiede Peinture, and one of the foremost connoisseurs of his day. He owned a large, important collection that included paintings by or attributed to Rembrandt van Rijn, Gerrit Dou, Nicolaes Berchem, Anthony van Dyck, Domenichino, Tintoretto, Guercino, Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin, and others, along with an extensive collection of Rembrandt etchings.","French"

Avercamp was a deaf-mute from birth, and was commonly known by his nickname,  de Stomme  or  de Stom,  translated as  the mute  in Dutch. It is generally assumed that he was a pupil of the history and portrait painter Pieter Isaacks, in whose house in Amsterdam he is thought to have lived in 1607. His style is distinctly linked to Flemish landscape painters such as Hans Bol, Gillis van Coninxloo, and David Vinckboons, who had fled to Amsterdam when Antwerp was invaded for a second time by the Spanish in 1585.Avercamp specialized in, and indeed virtually established the Dutch genre of animated and colorful winter scenes with people disporting on the ice. His imagery reflects the flush of creativity, optimism, and sense of Dutch identity issuing from Holland's achievement of independence from Spain during the early seventeenth century, which gave rise to the Golden Age of Dutch art and culture.","Dutch"

Bacchiacca borrowed from numerous sources, including the work of northern artists such as Albrecht Drer, theclassicizingengravings by his contemporary Marcantonio Raimondi, and theManneristpaintings of his onetime collaborator Jacopo Pontormo. Bacchiacca is best known for his small panel paintings with unusual combinations of color. In 1523 he worked with Pontormo on painted bedroom decorations, an influential collaboration which led to Bacchiacca's emphasis on crowded surfaces and the ambiguous, subjective space characteristic of Mannerism. By the early 1540s Bacchiacca returned to more conventionalclassicismbased on Michelangelo's models. Later on, he provided designs for tapestries. By this time the second generation of Mannerists--Agnolo Bronzino, Giorgio Vasari, and Francesco Salviati--had become rich sources ofmotifsfor Bacchiacca's art.","Italian"

After the plague killed his family in 1657, Baciccio moved to Rome, eventually becoming Gianlorenzo Bernini's protg. Seeing Correggio's works in Parma in 1669 gave Baciccio's decorations a heightenedillusionismand his easel pictures more tenderness.Baciccio's most celebrated work is the ceiling in the church of Il Ges in Rome, created from 1672 to 1683, whose conception owes much to his collaborator Bernini. In a dramatic innovation, Baciccio organized the ceiling's space by juxtaposing dark and light areas rather than by merely arranging the figures, and he merged painted figures with stucco ones joyously bursting from the frame.Baciccio also paintedaltarpiecesand mythological scenes. His portraits were so renowned that he was commissioned to paint seven popes. His many surviving drawings are all studies for paintings.","Italian"

Backer studied with Rembrandt for a short time after years of training in Leeuwarden, Holland, and in no time, he was successful. By 1633 the Amsterdam Orphan Home had commissioned a group portrait from him, and he painted three more large groups during his short career. Though he also painted mythological andallegoricalworks, Backer became known as a portrait specialist. Backer's style is characterized by quiet restraint, smooth, thin paint, and ornamental brushwork. His lighting can be more diffused than Rembrandt's focused, expressiveillumination. During the 1640s Backer fell under the spell of Bartholomeus van der Helst's fashionably pale, cool tonality, but the warmth of Backer'spaletteduring the last decade of his life indicates that he continued to study Rembrandt's works. Backer was one of Amsterdam's most famous painters. A 1649 print portraying Backer bears the inscription,  excellent painter in the large . . . who knows very well how to make a good nude.

Certainly in Bologna by 1503, Bagnacavallo showed a graceful manner and elongated figures in his early paintings. Raphael's influence dominated Bagnacavallo's mature career, but scholars are uncertain whether they ever met. According to Giorgio Vasari, Bagnacavallo traveled to Rome at some point while Raphael was there, between 1508 and 1520. One of Raphael'saltarpieces, with its clear geometry and sensuous presence, arrived in Bologna around 1514 and served as a strong, continuing reminder of modernclassicismfor local artists. Bagnacavallo and his peers also acquired information about this innovative style from the prints of fellow Bolognese artist Marcantonio Raimondi. Bagnacavallo's Raphaelesque paintings strongly influenced the early style of Pellegrino Tibaldi.","Italian"

Not surprisingly, he also made drawings and engravings of military costumes.Many of Baillie's prints and drawings reproduce seventeenth-century Dutch paintings or drawings in his own or aristocratic collections. He also specialized in prints after Rembrandt van Rijn's etchings and drawings.

Back in the Netherlands in 1613, he established himself as a painter of vanitas still lifes and portraits. He executed many small-scale drawings of fellow artists and students and professors at the University of Leiden.In his painted portraits, Bailly depicted attractive and expressive subjects in lively domestic settings. His vanitas paintings included the usual symbols of the transience and impermanence of human life, such as skulls, flowers, and burning or extinguished candles. He also included portraits of himself in these paintings, meaning to illustrate the ephemeral nature of his own artistic accomplishments. Though he sometimes intended his drawings as models for engravings, more often he made them as independently displayed works of art.","Dutch"
"b.  1889 Vitebsk, Russia, d.   1957 New York City","sculptor","Saul Baizerman","Saul Baizerman is best known for hammering copper by hand to create graceful relief sculptures. The artist often represented the female form with this innovative and labor-intensive technique. With deeply-rooted sympathies for the labor movement and social causes, Baizerman also favored less common subjects including the manual worker and the urban poor.During his youth in Russia, Baizerman became involved in the Russian Bolshevik movement. In 1906, he and his brother robbed a bank in order to contribute to the revolutionary cause. After a year and a half in jail, Baizerman escaped with his father's assistance and fled to the United States. Settling in New York, he trained as a sculptor at several art schools, while also working as a housepainter, machinist, and dressmaker.In the 1920s, Baizerman began shaping copper by hand. He would forcefully hammer both sides of a cold copper sheet until a cocoon-like image appeared in relief. This arduous process allowed Baizerman to align his artistic practice with the daily toil of the manual laborer to whom he remained profoundly sympathetic. In addition to producing copper pieces, Baizerman created an ambitious series of small-scale statuettes in bronze and plaster as an homage to the urban worker. He pursued  The City and the People  throughout his life; at his death, the series featured more than fifty pieces--from the  Crippled Sharpener  to the  Drunk Sailor.  A second ongoing project, the  Labor  series, equally expressed Baizerman's political commitment and solidarity with the working-class.As Baizerman gained in prominence, he created larger copper pieces intended for the outdoors. The artist's technique also took its toll. The violent banging reduced Baizerman's motor control of his hands and also damaged his hearing. His exposure to poisonous chemicals from soldering metal led to his death of cancer at age 68.","American"

In 1851 the Commission des Monuments Historiques (Historic Monuments Commission) asked Baldus to document architecture in France. These assignments, which were awarded to several photographers, were calledmissions hliographiques. In 1855 Baldus received his largest commission to document the construction of the Muse du Louvre.Photographic enlargements were not yet possible in the 1850s, so Baldus's photographs were contact prints from negatives as large as 10 x 14 inches.

Barocci's decorations for the Casino of Pope Pius IV at theVaticanused this technique and became so celebrated that they established his reputation as an up-and-coming young painter.Although his biographer Giovanni Bellori certainly exaggerated when he claimed that Barocci always worked from life, the artist did draw numerous preparatory studies. His diligence did not always please his patrons, however, for they often waited on his commissions.In 1565 Barocci returned to Urbino for good, claiming that he had been poisoned and working only two hours a day due to constant pain. Yet he continued to invent new compositional strategies, incorporating the viewer into his circle of foreground figures in theMadonna del Popoloof 1579 (Galleria degli Uffizi).

Working in the northern Italian regions of the Veneto and Lombardy, he began as a painter of small, devotional paintings and developed into a fashionable portraitist. He probably trained with Venetian master Gentile Bellini. His earliest dated painting, aVirgin and Child,also shows the influence of Giovanni Bellini's paintings of that subject. In his early career Bartolomeo frequently copied and signed religious works by other painters from northeastern Italy such as the Bellinis.Bartolomeo worked at the Este court in Ferrara from 1505 to 1508, where he developed his style in the rich culture of theRenaissancecourt there. By 1520 he was a successful portrait painter in Milan, depicting fashionable young men in contemporary costume. Leonardo da Vinci had revived portraiture there and Bartolomeo's style displays Leonardo's influence. A strongchiaroscurogives structural coherence and a new psychological suggestiveness to his paintings, as in the Getty Museum'sLady Playing a Lute.Bartolomeo's sitters are characterized by elaborate costumes depicted in meticulous detail.

After serving inNapoleon'sarmy, he studied sculpture and painting and entered thecole des Beaux-Artsin 1818. Like the painters Thodore Gricault and Eugne Delacroix, with whom he studied the animals at the Paris zoo, Barye exemplified theRomanticpredilection for exotic and violent subjects; many of his bronzes depict wild beasts in combat.At theSalonof 1831, he won a medal forTiger Devouring a Gavail,a crocodile-like creature.This large-scale sculpture's subject was a radical choice, departing from the Acadmie's strict hierarchy, which ranked the human figure as art's noblest subject and animals as one of the lowliest. With the success of this work, Barye began working independently as a sculptor and painter. He continued submitting his animal bronzes to the Salons, where they competed on equal terms with sculptures of more traditional human subjects.About 1845 Barye established afoundryto produce small bronzes for France's growing middle class. He was appointed keeper ofplaster castsat theLouvreand master of zoological drawing at the Muse National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris. Finally elected to theAcadmiein 1868, Barye inspired a school of sculptors known as theanimaliers,or animal artists.","French"

A pioneer ingenre scenesand landscape painting, Jacopo initially trained with his father in the town of Bassano. By 1534 he had found his direction in the art of nearby Venice, learning as much from thechiaroscuroand luxurious color of Titian's works as from his teachers. He always stayed abreast of developments in Venetian painting, sometimes borrowing details from Lorenzo Lotto's works in his portraits. Engravings were critical in forming Jacopo's style, particularly those by and after artists like Albrecht Drer, Raphael, and Parmigianino. Local taste required that art illustrate reality, and Jacopo drew inspiration from the simple human scenes, farm life, and changing aspects of nature he observed in his hometown. To Mannerism's energy, extreme movement, and tightly compressed space, he added realism and earthiness. A humble and subtle observer, his sitters may seem unaware of his presence. Increasingly, he used religious and philosophical subjects as pretexts for painting genre scenes and landscapes. Jacopo's workshop was a minor industry in Bassano, and his four sons continued his style into the next century.","Italian"

In the 1460s he may have collaborated with Giovanni Bellini on threetriptychsfor a major Venetian church. In the 1480s he worked with Gentile Bellini for theScuolaGrande di San Marco, aconfraternitydedicated to doing good works.

From 1735 he received many commissions foraltarpiecesas well as for mythological and historical pictures. He often took poses from real statues and used ancient literature as subject matter.Batoni's sensibility was joyful and elegant, mirroring the carefree attitude of eighteenth-century society as a whole. It is said that more than 150 Englishmen alone sat for him. His sitters appreciated his polished precision and the air of informal modernity he created by placing them in semi-natural settings featuring Roman sculptures, architecture, or archaeological finds--often those they themselves had admired or even acquired. He painted three popes and many princes, and his clients included Catherine the Great of Russia.

Bayard was reportedly persuaded by a friend of Daguerre to postpone the announcement of his findings, thus missing the opportunity to be recognized as the inventor of the medium. In 1840 he responded to this injustice by creating perhaps the first example of political-protest photography, a portrait of himself as a drowned man, upon which he wrote:The corpse which you see here is that of M. Bayard, inventor of the process that has just been shown to you. As far as I know this indefatigable experimenter has been occupied for about three years with his discovery. The Government, which has been only too generous to Monsieur Daguerre, has said it can do nothing for Monsieur Bayard, and the poor wretch has drowned himself.

Giovanni created the soft, luminous art of saturated color that brought Venetian painting into theRenaissanceand helped Venice rival Florence as the center of artistic production. His father Jacopo headed a successful workshop where Giovanni and his brother Gentile painted until about 1470. The precisely organized, linear style of brother-in-law Andrea Mantegna was an early influence as well. Around 1475 the Sicilian Antonello da Messina brought oil painting to Venice, and Giovanni soon switched to the new technique. His vision remained contemplative and poetic, but his style became warmer and more luminous. Giovanni showed that landscape could establish mood rather than just acting as a backdrop, and he integrated figures harmoniously into his landscapes.Giovanni's large workshop producedaltarpieces, devotional works, and sensitive, compelling portraits, as well as highly influential half-length Madonnas. Through his workshop's activity, Giovanni directly or indirectly influenced the Venetian painters of his and the next generation, including Sebastiano del Piombo, Lorenzo Lotto, and Vittore Carpaccio. His work also deeply impressed Fra Bartolommeo, who visited Venice in 1507.  He spent his career exploring new ideas, including those of such illustrious pupils as Titian and Giorgione.","Italian"

He built most of his own equipment, from his camera to a stereograph-mounting machine. Ever the inventor, he developed an instantaneous shutter that allowed him to stop action and built a solar printing house on iron rollers, now at the Smithsonian Institution, that could be rotated 280 degrees so that the printing racks could face the sun all day. With his first and second wives and five children, he ran the Bennett Studio from 1865 until 1908. That studio is still run by his descendents today.Summing up his career, Bennett wrote that his  energies for near a lifetime have been used almost entirely to win such prominence as [he] could in outdoor photography.  He was renowned as a landscape photographer who presented the Wisconsin Dells, now a major resort area, as a safe though untamed wilderness. In his zeal to represent his beloved landscape, Bennett was said to have engaged in a bit of deceit, such as whitewashing the interiors of caves to make their interiors visible on early glass plate negatives.","American"

Bertin's paintings are firmly rooted in the Neoclassical school of painting, characterized by tight compositions and smooth brushwork, as well as mythological or antique subjects. But Bertin was also an early proponent of sketching outdoors--a practice of direct observation in order to replicate nature in studio-made paintings of imagined, idealized scenes. Bertin encouraged the practice ofplein airto his students, and it later it became a respected genre in its own right.Bertin attended the Royal Academy of Painting in Paris, initially as a student of history painting, the most highly regarded genre in a rigidly structured, academic salon system. For three years he studied with history painter Gabriel-Franois Doyen. By 1788, he discovered an interest in landscape painting and entered the studio of Neoclassical painter Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes. Valenciennes devised a new category, thepaysage historique, which infused landscape painting with an idealized, heroic view of history in order to bolster respect for the lowly genre. Bertin embraced it throughout his career.Plein airpainting in Italy was a longstanding tradition for aspiring landscape painters. Bertin made scenes of precisely identified Italian locations, suggesting that he may have visited between 1806 and 1808. He painted outdoors in the Ile-de-France region near his home in Paris. Bertin's most famous student was Camille Corot, whose art later influenced the Impressionist painters.","French"

Besnier also distinguished himself as the co-director of the Beauvais Manufactory from 1734 to 1753.When the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry was named director of Beauvais in 1734, he selected his great friend Besnier to join him. Not only an accomplished artist but also an astute businessman, Besnier looked after the commercial side of the factory while Oudry concentrated on artistic matters. Before the Besnier-Oudry partnership, Beauvais had continually lost money and frequently had difficulty paying its workers, buying wool and silk, and commissioning newcartoons. The two friends realized that they had to increase sales by providing new designs to reflect changing tastes. Their ideas were immediately successful, and they were soon able to hire new weavers to complete numerous orders from as far away as Denmark and Sweden.After about twenty years as the director of Beauvais, Besnier finally retired in December 1753 and died six months later.","French"

After studying with his uncle Pieter Aertsen, who pioneered the new subjects of kitchen and market scenes, Beuckelaer took up this genre. These popular pictures displayed abundant food, with people either standing around or preparing a meal, while thebackgroundnearly always contained a religious scene. The paintings often had a moralizing purpose, illustrating the opposition between worldly and spiritual values and warning of the pleasures of the flesh.Beuckelaer sometimes placed scenes in idealized townscapes, but he also created richly peopled wooded landscapes and riverbanks, with a strong sensitivity for atmosphere. He had no immediate followers in Antwerp, but his work was popular in northern Italy, inspiring Annibale Carracci to paint market and kitchen scenes. According to contemporary biographers, Beuckelaer flooded the market with inexpensive paintings, which only became valuable after his death. He frequently worked for other artists and probably participated in monumental projects for churches. From the later 1560s, he used canvas rather than panel and concentrated on large formats.","Flemish"

Dulac paid for Bidauld to go to Italy, where he remained for five years; while there, he dedicated himself exclusively to landscape painting. Bidauld's journey was to have a fundamental impact on his artistic outlook, which remained nearly unchanged for the next sixty years. His paintings have cool lighting, meticulously painted foliage and architecture, and sweeping vistas that conformed to then-popular precepts about Neo-classical landscapes. Bidauld regularly exhibited at the ParisSalonbetween 1791 and 1844, winning a gold medal in 1812. When Neo-classicism lost favor, Bidauld was unable to adapt to changing styles and, as a consequence, fell out of fashion.

The painters of this group were particularly interested in depicting emotion and frequently rendered the faces of their subjects in three-quarter view, rather than in profile, which made it easier to convey facial expressions.

He believed that the arts offered insights into the metaphysical world and could potentially redeem a humanity fallen into materialism and doubt. His belief that imagination is the artist's critical filter indicated the dawn of Romanticism, but his peers failed to recognize his genius until his later years. A hosiery salesman's son, Blake trained by attending drawing school in London in 1767, apprenticing to an engraver, and enrolling in the Royal Academy's school in 1779. During the 1780s Blake worked as a commercial engraver and publishing his poems at home.

He specialized in printing and issuing portfolios of photographs by other photographers, but perhaps his most significant contribution was the introduction in 1850 of thealbumenpaper print process, the primary printing medium until gelatin papers superceded it in the late 1800s.Once a painter on ivory andporcelain, Blanquart-Evrard sent examples of his experiments with negative positive paper processes to the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in London in 1851. A note attached to a frame explained:  These prints were obtained by a new process which makes it possible to produce two or three hundred prints from the same negative the same day in rainy weather.  That same year Blanquart-Evrard started a printing company, the Imprimerie Photographique,to mass-produce photographic prints by other photographers, including John Beasly Greene, Charles Marville and Henri Le Secq.

He worked under six masters, for one of whom he was also a houseboy. He absorbed theMannerismof the School ofFontainebleau, which stayed with him for life. Except for a short period in Amsterdam, he lived in Utrecht, becoming so important that Peter Paul Rubens visited him in 1627. Around 1600, landscape became increasingly vital to his art; over time, the subject matter of these landscapes became incidental, even difficult to find. Bloemaert's landscapes incorporated Mannerism's restless light effects and strong contrasts, richly coloredpalette, and lots of movement and detail. Franois Boucher later recognized a kindred spirit, incorporating many of Bloemaert'smotifsin his painting.In the 1620s Bloemaert's pupil Gerrit van Honthorst imported Caravaggio's ideas to Utrecht from Italy. Bloemaert developed a decorative synthesis of Caravaggio's contrasting light effects and Mannerism's bright, acid colors. Always open to fresh ideas, Bloemaert depicted mythological and religious subjects completely new to Dutch art, designed tapestries, stained-glass windows, and made over 1,500 drawings.

"b.  1935 Brooklyn, New York","sculptor","Donald Blumberg","Donald Blumberg's style is characterized not by specific subjects, but by his creative use of them to explore aspects of perception such as time, motion, and space. Blumberg first gained attention for his seriesIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedral(1973). In those images, he emphasized the starkly lit shapes of Roman Catholic worshippers as they stood or walked out of the cathedral's cavernous entrance on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Blumberg was inspired by the untrained vision of young gang members he had taught while volunteering for an urban anti-poverty program. Blumberg later said of their pictures:  Images were often fragmented, hands and heads truncated by the frame's edge. Figures floated upside down and obliquely, without regard to traditional horizontal-vertical relationships and perspective. Blumberg initially trained as a scientist, earning degrees in biology from Cornell University in 1959 and the University of Colorado in 1961. A trip to Europe during graduate school changed the course of his life. Heady from experiencing works of art such as J. W. M. Turner's seascapes in London and Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna, he completed his degree, and then moved to New York City, where he initially sought out his subject matter in the streets. His work became increasingly conceptual, exploring principles that are intrinsic to the medium of black and white photography, specifically the relationship of figure to background, the tension between two-dimensional representation and three-dimensional reality, and the possibilities presented by the gray scale inherent to black-and-white photography.In the mid-1960s, Blumberg's photographs were featured in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York. In 1965, Blumberg began a long career teaching photography in university art programs, which in turn inspired his own work as he considered the relationship between formal learning and art making. He taught at the State University of New York at Buffalo (1965-81) and the Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design in Los Angeles (1981-90). Among his best-known portfolios and books are:Daily Photographs(1972),Portraits of Students(1972), andIn Front of St. Patrick's Cathedral(1973).","American"

Later in his career, Bocanegra worked in Seville and Madrid, where he becamecourt painterin 1676.In 1670 Bocanegra painted the life of the Virgin for a church in Granada; these paintings displayed Cano's influence in their lively coloring and dynamiccompositions, along with vigorous Baroqueillusionisticeffects.

Between 1635 and 1637, Boeckhorst toured Italy, returning in 1639 to see Rome.Boeckhorst worked both independently and in collaboration with other artists. Early in his career he added staffage, flowers, and animals to other artists' paintings; later on, he painted figures for them as well. In the 1630s he contributed figures to Frans Snyders's paintings; in turn, Snyders added still life elements to Boeckhorst's works. After Rubens's death in 1640, Boeckhorst finished and touched up some of his master's paintings. Until about 1650, Boeckhorst's figure types and compositions closely follow Rubens's late work; after that Anthony Van Dyck's influence can be felt. After 1650 Boeckhorst painted numerous altarpieces and other works for churches and monasteries outside Antwerp, along with paintings of the Old Testament and mythological subjects for private individuals and art dealers.

One signed original statue by Boethos survives: a bronzehermfrom a shipwreck off the coast of Tunisia near the city of Mahdia, now in the Bardo Museum in Tunis. The Getty Museum's herm so closely resembles the one in Tunis, both stylistically and technically, that it too must have been made in Boethos's workshop.The two similar herms, one signed and one unsigned, raise questions about the role of the artist and the organization of workshops in ancient Greece. In bronze casting, numerous versions of a work can be produced from the same mold, making the precise role of the artist signing the work unclear.

In 1794, an erotic painting elicited accusations of obscenity--an offense that carried the threat of prison and harsh penalties. A keen observer of human behavior, Boilly turned his attention to more public scenes, depicting the social customs of Parisians at the Salon, on the promenade, at the billiard table. He meticulously recorded facial details and gestures, and his depictions of costumes and textiles are fascinating as a chronicle of fashion.

Bol witnessed a document concerning Rembrandt's wife Saskia's inheritance in 1640, a responsibility that suggests that by then Bol was probably no longer a student but a full-fledged assistant.After having risen quickly through the ranks in Rembrandt's highly productive studio, Bol established himself as an independent master around 1642. He imitated Rembrandt's style so closely that some works were mistaken for Rembrandt's for centuries afterward. Although his style changed, throughout his career Bol painted the same subjects as Rembrandt: histories, portraits--often with sitters posed by a window--and exotically costumed single figures.Around 1650 Bol's taste drifted to more  modern  trends: Hispalettelightened, and his figures grew more noble and elegant.

Despite the war with Spain and periods of religious unrest that caused frequent upheavals in his life, Bol remained one of the Netherlands' most prolific and successful landscapists. He painted some oil paintings,illuminatedabreviaryfor a French duke, and made many drawings that were the basis for engravings.

Although he ultimately devoted himself almost exclusively to painting, he first trained as a sculptor, enrolling at the RomanAccademia di San Lucaat age fifteen.As a painter, Bompiani depicted historical, mythological, and religious subjects in a conservative, idealized style, making his figures physically perfect and giving them noble, spiritual expressions. An art historian at the time wrote that despite Bompiani's conservative approach,  he showed himself open to new ideas and emancipated himself in his best work almost entirely from what was narrow and conventional in the style imposed upon him by his early training. In later years, Bompiani increasingly painted landscape watercolors. In the late 1870s, he began painting a series of portraits that included his wife and members of the Borghese family. He served as a professor and ultimately president of the RomanAccademia di San Luca.","Italian"

He painted his earliest known work, a still life, while employed as a clerk for the Paris police. Deeply inspired by the Dutch master paintings of the 1600s that he saw at theLouvre, Bonvin painted still lifes andgenre scenescharacterized by a quiet, intimate, and meditative style. Many of his genre scenes display Pieter de Hooch's influence.After becoming acquainted with Gustave Courbet, Bonvin became a leading exponent ofRealism. Though he had little money, he encouraged and supported other artists, frequently giving supplies to his talented half-brother, Leon Bonvin. When theSalonrejected his fellow Realists James McNeill Whistler and Henri Fantin-Latour in 1859, Bonvin exhibited their work in hisatelier. In his later years, he spent time in the Netherlands and London before settling in a small French village. He continued to draw and paint everyday objects and local scenes with delicately rendered light and shadow.","French"

He was largely self-taught, though his older half-brother Franois, who had garnered recognition among Paris's Realist painters, encouraged him and gave him supplies. Bonvin's earliest drawings were small, somber charcoal and ink sketches of his bleak environment.While earning his living as an innkeeper, Bonvin drew directly from nature, recording the fields and flowers near his home and interior views of the inn. By the 1860s, he had turned exclusively to watercolor, creating landscapes and still lifes with remarkable luminosity. Franois encouraged him to study the Dutch andFlemishmasters' meticulousrealismand use of outline. By outlining the forms in sepia-toned ink, Bonvin achieved distinctive, almost photographic effects in his watercolors. After his marriage in 1861, Bonvin's financial situation worsened and his inn lost money. In January 1866 he traveled to Paris to try to sell his watercolors. The day after an art dealer refused his work, the despairing artist hanged himself in the forest of Meudon. A posthumous sale of his watercolors raised over 8,000 francs to benefit his destitute family.","French"

He was also asked to appraise the engraving plates of another mapmaker.Borde did not limit himself to engraving maps but also financed their costly production.

When Bordone received his first commission in 1518, the powerful Titian promptly took it for himself. After winning a 1534 competition that failed to attract important Venetian commissions, Bordone found work elsewhere.The particulars of Bordone's artistic development remain unclear, because he repeated figure studies from his model book throughout his career. Always consistent, however, was his delight in texture and detail, seen in luxurious fabrics, lustrous gems, and soft, supple skin. Around 1538 he worked atFontainebleau, where his style absorbed the rhythmic grace, expressive artifice, and sensuality of the other Italian painters there. Bordone increasingly became identified with glossy portraiture, frequently illustrating the theme of problematic love. He often painted beautiful courtesans and erotic mythological andallegoricalsubjects, which appealed to his wealthy clients.After meeting Lorenzo Lotto in Venice during the 1540s, Bordone imbued his portraits with a new intimacy. He traveled extensively in the 1540s and 1550s, working in Milan, Bavaria, Fontainebleau, and his native Treviso. Around 1560 Bordone again returned to Venice, then as one of its most famous artists.","Italian"

Not surprisingly, flower painters were among the best-paid artists. In 1621, Ambrosius Bosschaert commanded a thousand guilders for a single flower picture. Nonetheless, his output was relatively small, for he was also an art dealer, handling works by artists like Paolo Veronese. Anticipating religious persecution, in 1587 Bosschaert's parents moved from Antwerp to Middelburg, a seaport and trading center second in importance only to Amsterdam. Six years later Bosschaert joined Middelburg'sGuildofSaint Luke. Bosschaert originated agenrethat continued in that city until the mid-1600s: a symmetrically composed bouquet of flowers painted with seemingly scientific accuracy, more voluminous than those of his Antwerp contemporary Jan Brueghel the Elder. Bosschaert's works have been called flower portraits; each flower receives the same detailed attention as a face in a portrait. Usually small scale and on copper, Bosschaert's paintings combined blooms from different seasons, painted from separate studies of each flower. It is not unusual to find the same flower, shell, or insect in many pictures. Like his predecessors, Bosschaert sometimes included symbolic or religious meanings, such as the transience of life.","Dutch"

His style acquired a contemporary, sociopolitical slant and later embracedRomanticism, incorporating a more poetic and sensual approach. Back in Milan, Bossi served as secretary at the academy until 1807. He developed a major library and founded its art gallery, acquiring important paintings by such artists as Raphael. He also prevented many works from being smuggled abroad or dispersed.Bossi always associated with intellectuals and artists--Antonio Canova was a great friend and admirer--and displayed a range of interests.

When he was only nineteen years old, Bttger caught the attention of Frederick Augustus I, Elector of Saxony, who heard the young man's boast that he could produce gold from base metals. The impoverished ruler, welcoming the opportunity to refill his state's coffers, quickly summoned him. The supposed gold-maker panicked and fled but was soon caught and ordered to stay under virtual house arrest until he revealed his secret formula. While trying to produce heat-resistant crucibles for goldmaking, Bttger developed an especially hard and dense red stoneware.For nearly six years, Bttger experimented desperately. Although unable to produce gold, he did manage to make another important breakthrough-the recipe for  true  or hard-paste porcelain. Until his discovery, Europeans had had to rely on costly imports of Chinese and Japanese porcelain to satisfy their desire for this delicate material. On March 28, 1709, Bttger finally perfected translucent white porcelain. The Elector quickly established a manufactory at Meissen to start production and hired others to help refine the new material and to create colored enamels to decorate it. Bttger discovered few colors before his death but still managed to revolutionize the porcelain market.","German"

He learned to make architectural drawings withpainterlyeffects of light and shadow. Although few of his designs were ever realized, his drawings have always been admired for both their beauty and their invention.By the 1780s Boulle focused only on his roles as educator, academician, and theoretician. Committed to ideas of symbolic power, he believed that architecture could elicit moral and emotional responses when the combination of forms suggested a union with divinity. He theorized that the abstract, geometric forms he used were the basis for beauty through their regularity, symmetry, and variety.Boulle preserved his principles in a treatise, which he illustrated with magnificent drawings for public projects he designed between 1778 and 1788, but the treatise remained unpublished until 1953.

De Boulogne only documented work hung inSaint Peter's Basilicanext to Poussin's only public picture in Rome. Both men painted religious and secularcompositionsfor privatepatrons, but their art could not have been more different. Poussin's approach was intellectual: he insisted on harmony in his compositions, and he painted the ideal and the abstract. De Boulogne's approach, on the other hand, was personal and dramatic.

At about age twenty, Breenbergh went to Rome, where he lived with Flemish landscapist Paul Brill and was influenced by the intimate, deeply poetic landscapes of German expatriate Adam Elsheimer. Breenbergh belonged to the first generation of Dutch Italianates, artists who traveled to Italy in the 1620s and were inspired by its light and atmosphere. With Cornelis van Poelenburgh, whose early style is very similar, Breenbergh helped to bring the Italianate tradition of landscape to the Low Countries, reflecting a fascination on the part of northern European artists with Italian landscapes rather than with the local topography.In Holland by 1633, Breenbergh specialized in scenes including Roman ruins, based on his drawings of Italy. In the 1630s he began introducing biblical and mythological figures and his compositions became larger and more ambitious. Breenbergh often painted Old Testament themes, but he placed the scenes themselves far in his landscape's background. His expressive figure types reveal affinities with those of Pieter Lastman. After 1645 he turned from landscape to narrative scenes and later painted portraits as well. By 1652 his productivity had dropped significantly; he may have become a merchant.","Dutch"

From 1915 to 1919, Brockhurst lived in Ireland, where he met painter Augustus John, whose painting style was influenced by contemporary French art's simplicity of color and forms. In 1919 Brockhurst returned to England for his first significant gallery exhibition. During the 1920s Brockhurst became an etcher, focusing primarily on female portraits and using his wife as his model. Coolness, technical perfection, and overt classicism mark both his printmaking style and his painting manner. By 1930 Brockhurst had returned to painting with a new teenage model, Dorette Woodard, whom he later married. His haunting portraits of her opened the door to fame and fortune, and he became a fashionable portrait painter; his stated goal was to capturing appearance, not character. His sitters included J. Paul Getty, Marlene Dietrich, and the Duchess of Windsor. In 1939, at the height of his success, Brockhurst settled in the United States.","British"

By about 1530 Bronzino had moved away from Pontormo's nervous sensibility and developed an art and career independent of his master. His new style was first evident in his portraits. For Bronzino, a portrait was a mask. Rather than revealing the sitter's character, the Florentine aimed to convey his subject's social standing, elegance, and restraint. Bronzino expressed the material world in his portraits; the enameled colors and attention to depicting details like his sitters' lace collars, hair, and jewelry, and even the veins in their hands gave his portraits a remote decorativeness.As court painter to Cosimo I de'Medici, first Grand Duke of Tuscany, Bronzino also painted religious works, which he approached with the same cool detachment as his portraits. Between  1546 and 1548, Bronzino lived in Rome. Hisallegoricalpaintings influenced younger Mannerist painters with their distorted poses, exaggerated expressions, and emphasis on movement. In his later work, Bronzino discarded his frozen passion, conceiving his public paintings as cumulative displays of his encyclopedic knowledge of art history and his talent for assimilating it into his own works, a notion that also typifiedMannerism.","Italian"

Many of his images, taken under extremely dangerous conditions in the midst of ground combat, convey the chaos of battle in a way no photographer before had captured.One of Capa's most famous images,Death of a Spanish Loyalist,helped to define the genre of photojournalism as it has evolved in recent decades. Taken at the precise moment that the soldier was shot dead and falling backward, it conveys a sense of bravery on the part of the soldier, but also lets viewers understand that Capa was himself in harm's way. Capa's bravado led him to wade into the Atlantic Ocean off of Normandy, France along with D-Day troops in World War II. Under a hail of bullets from the German troops above the shore, Capa shot dozens of images from theperspectiveof the American invasion force. In a famous incident, much of Capa's film from that day was ruined when a lab technician placed the film in an overheated dryer, melting the emulsion.In 1947, Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Bill Vandivert, and several other photographers formed the cooperative photo agency, Magnum. Cartier-Bresson later said of Magnum's unique, almost artistic, photojournalistic philosophy:  Life isn't made of stories that you can cut into slices like an apple pie. There's no standard way of approaching a story. We have to evoke a situation, a truth. This is the poetry of life's reality. Capa accompanied troops to Indochina in 1954. While there, he unknowingly walked across a land mine after straying from the main group, and died soon after.","American"

As apprentice to his brother, Carducho was steeped in theclassicalItalian tradition: his paintings featured careful drawing, smooth surfaces, andclassicizingcompositions. In 1609 Vicente succeeded his brother as royal painter, a position he kept for life. After Diego Velzquez arrived in 1623, however, Carducho and othercourt paintersoften found themselves overshadowed by the young genius.Carducho primarily painted religious subjects. In 1632 he completed Europe's most extended cycle of monastic paintings: fifty-six influential canvases illustrating the lives of Saint Bruno and other Carthusians for a Carthusianmonasterynear Segovia. Carducho may be most recognized for his contributions to Spanish art theory. HisDilogos de la Pinturaof 1633 championed Michelangelo and the Italian classical tradition while defending painting as a noble pursuit. The artist, wrote Carducho, is a learnedhumanist, not just a craftsman; painters should uplift people morally. In attacking Caravaggio's new dramatic realism and its  external copying of nature,  Carducho called him a  monster of genius and talent,   Anti-Michelangelo  and  Anti-Christ. ","Spanish; Italian"

Scholars considered him the first artist to have consciously emphasized the importance and grandeur of Venice by depicting it as a center of international activity. Carlevarijs began his career in 1703 with the monumental publication ofThe Buildings and Views of Venice Designed inPerspectiveand Engraved by Luca Carlevarijs.The illustrations of 104 views of Venice were, at the time, considered  the most complete survey of the fabric of the city ever produced.  Because the publication was considered by many as patriotic, Carlevarijs won favor and patronage from the residents of Venice. Carlevarijs documented many diplomatic scenes such as the arrival of dignitaries to Venice, who were customarily greeted with elaborate celebrations in their honor. The paintings were then given to the dignitaries to take home, where they would serve as a type of advertisement for the dramatic and lavish city. Although large pageant paintings were Carlevarijs's most notable commissions, he also made dynamic drawings and oil sketches of everyday Venetian life, conveying the vivacity of a busy city.","Italian"

Adopting theManneriststyle of Fontainebleau, he used unnatural color and exaggerated poses for figures; his similarly farfetched subjects includedallegoriesof the French court, violent massacres, and fantasy and magic. Caron's contemporaries admired his drawings, and numerous printmakers reproduced them during his lifetime. He was even commissioned to make a series of paintings glorifying the widowhood of QueenCatherine de' Medici; the drawings were later used as tapestry designs.

Britain and Brittany were transformed into the canal city in one of his most famous cycles,The Legend ofSaint Ursula,commissioned by Venice'sScuolaof Saint Ursula, a fraternity of merchants and craftsmen, for their meeting hall adjacent to a Dominican church. When he completed the cycle in 1498, Venetians delighted in the pageantlike scenes of familiar sights: dogs and pet monkeys, lounging cavaliers, flying flags, and bustling activity everywhere. A native of Venice, Carpaccio was born into a family of fishermen and boat builders. He was probably a student of Gentile Bellini, a Venetian painter of incident-fillednarratives, and assistant to Gentile's brother Giovanni, but Carpaccio ultimately developed his own fanciful storytelling style. Though he painted religious works and secular panel paintings, his main vocation comprised huge, narrative canvases for the Venetianscuole,whose tastes for richly colored panoramas celebrating the city's success perfectly matched his talents. By tapping into the conservative patronage in Venice, Carpaccio continued painting until his death, virtually impervious to the new doctrines of painting introduced by such artists as Titian.","Italian"

As with most vase-painters, the real name of the Carpenter Painter is unknown. His name comes from his depiction of a carpenter at work on a cup now in London in the British Museum. Details of the figures in his pictures-such as the way he drew clavicles, pectorals, nipples, turned down corners of the mouth, long slender hands, and garment folds-identify his work. Although few works by this vase-painter have been identified, it appears that he painted primarily cups.

They trained most of the next generation's major Bolognese painters, including Domenichino and Guercino, to draw from life and to emphasize realistic, solid form. The leastclassicalof the three, Lodovico's own influence on the younger generation was significant. Guercino in particular seized on Lodovico's emotionalism, his decorative patterns, rich textures, and hispainterlyBaroqueapproach to color and light. The mystery of Lodovico's devotional works and the aristocratic sentiment of his portraits were unmatched by either cousin. After Agostino and Annibale left Bologna in the mid-1590s, Lodovico ran the Academy alone. Without their stimulation, he declined into a painter of large, rather sentimentalaltarpieces.","Italian"

By 1585, it was the most popular teaching academy in Bologna and a rallying point for progressive artistic tendencies. In reaction to theManneristdistortion of anatomy and space, the Carracci emphasized drawing from life. Agostino was principally an engraver as well as a gifted teacher. His systematic drawings studying the parts of the human body were engraved after his death and became important teaching tools for the next two hundred years. In 1597, Agostino joined Annibale in Rome to work on the monumental Farnese Galleryfrescoes. Three years later, after a falling out, Agostino left for another Farnese family project in Parma, where he died prematurely in 1602.","Italian"

There they revived the practice of working from life, focusing on the craft of art rather than the elegant life ofcourt painters. The Carracci were tireless observers. Scholars credit Annibale with teachingcaricatureand helping to revive the process of creating extensive preparatory drawings for paintings.Between 1597 and 1601, Carracci worked on the gallery ceiling of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, his most important legacy. Conceiving the ceiling as open to the sky, he painted its mythological love scenes as framed easel pictures within anillusionisticframework. After receiving a paltry five hundredlirefor this extensive decoration, he suffered a breakdown. A prolific draftsman, Carracci derived his heroic figure style from antique sculpture and Michelangelo and Raphael's art, but he added a richness and buoyancy from his copious studies from life.

He lived with an aristocratic family, in their home near the Pantheon, and studied at an art academy. During this period, he came into contact with the painter, Cristoforo Roncalli.

But by around 1610, Cavarozzi had come under the influence of Caravaggio, many of whose paintings could be seen in Rome.In 1617, Cavarozzi traveled to Madrid.

Equally apparent is this itinerant painter's importance: he spread the new artistic ideas of the HighRenaissance, transmitting elements of Raphael's style to northern Italy and aspects of Leonardo to Italy's southern regions.Cesare was originally from Lombardy; little is known about his education. As early as 1506, he may have been in Rome, working with Baldassare Peruzzi and probably coming into contact with the young Raphael. After his years in Rome, Cesare probably spent time in Milan. His paintings from this period display his characteristic marriage of Leonardo's means of expression and theme with Raphael's articulation of human form.By 1514 Cesare had left Milan, traveling south, probably through Rome, Florence, and Siena, then settling in Naples and Messina. There his paintings influenced local artists learning the High Renaissance style.

The prince was only one of several aristocrats who established factories in France and Germany in the eighteenth century, searching for the elusive recipe for true porcelain like that produced in China and Japan. The factory's early production consisted of pieces painted in imitation of Japanese ceramics, probably copied directly from the prince's substantial collection. Other designs adapted simplified Eastern motifs, often inaccurately, to create brightly colored, richly patterned works.Chantilly's early works were made from soft-paste porcelain covered with an opaque tin glaze that produced a lustrous background for the painted decoration in enamel colors. The manufactory specialized in delicately modeled jugs, tureens, plates, teapots, and cups and saucers shaped like leaves. They also produced more fanciful designs, such as bald smiling Chinese figures, sometimes squatting beside vases that serve as potpourri or perfume burners. After the prince's death in 1740 removed the factory's chief financial support, Chantilly's fortunes began to waver; as a result, the wares became less innovative.","French"

Although Christenberry has long worked in a variety of media, he became known in the early 1970s as a pioneer of fine art color photography, somewhat ironically through small, straightforward snapshots of his subjects. In recent decades, Christenberry's art has consisted of large-format photographs of the same vernacular structures, as well as sculptures that resemble architectural models but are influenced by memory and association more than exacting observation. A large body of his work focuses on the Klu Klux Klan, a part of southern culture he abhors but feels cannot be ignored.Christenberry grew up in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but each summer stayed on the farms of his grandparents in rural Hale County. In the late 1950s, he earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa. The initial color photographs he made--with a Brownie camera he received as a child--were made as visual reference for the subjects he wanted to paint. In 1960, he had a life-changing experience: he encountered the bookLet Us Now Praise Famous Menand realized that his grandparents had known the poor sharecropper families whose lives were documented in it. Initially inspired by James Agee's writing and Walker Evans's portraits, Christenberry sought out Evans in New York City in 1961.

Cuyp's earliest works share Jan van Goyen's monochromatic style, but by 1648 he may have visited Utrecht, Holland's artistic center, whereItalianateinfluence was strong. Cuyp's 1650s works display greater coloristic differentiation and the soft, golden glow of Italian light. Working in provincial isolation, he had little effect on other Dutch painters. His compositions were popular with eighteenth-century English collectors, and his poetic light exerted a strong influence on English painting.","Italian"

He was expelled from Mantua in 1450 after having been convicted of a grave crime, and he eventually settled in Pavia sometime before 1461. His most famous work is the Visconti Hours, a book of hours commissioned by Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, which Belbello completed after two other artists had left it unfinished. Especially toward the end of his career, he collaborated on manuscript projects with accomplished northern Italian painters and illuminators such as Andrea Mantegna and Girolamo da Cremona. Belbello painted strongly modeled, monumental figures with close-set facial features, and he was known for his distinctive use of bright colors such as blues, yellows, and pinks. He often filled the borders of the pages he illuminated with lush flowers and plants with heavy, fleshy leaves. His fanciful compositions and unusual treatment of familiar iconographic themes set him apart from other artists working at the time.","Italian"

Primarily a fresco and panel painter, Stefano's only known illuminated manuscript commission is a choir book from which only six illuminations survive.

He painted scaled-down human figures in small, luminous landscapes of carefully rendered plants and flowers.In 1842 Dadd left England on a one-year drawing trip throughout Europe and the Middle East. Shortly after his return, he lost his sanity, as had three of his siblings. Dadd murdered his father, attempted to kill a stranger, and spoke of killing the pope and the emperor of Austria, insisting that the Egyptian god Osiris requested these acts.

As the leading Florentine painter of his generation, Daddi helped to ensure that this idea, which heralded the Renaissance and came to be taken for granted until the modern age, was kept alive. For hundreds of years, Italian painting had been based on the abstractions of Byzantine art, which stressed patterning, flatness, and ethereal-looking people. Daddi's figures, like Giotto's, have bulk and physicality. As in everyday experience, their form is modeled by light that is earthly and real. Still, throughout his career, Daddi retained some elements of Byzantium's legacy of abstraction, choosing its almond-shaped eyes, ornamental patterning, and gold backgrounds.Like many in Florence's post-Giotto generation, Daddi later was probably influenced by Sienese art, with its gracefulness and tender human relationships. Ivory carvings from France also may have contributed to the lyric sweetness of his art. He rarely painted frescoes. His large workshop specialized in small, devotional panels, which retain a sense of intimacy even when intended for public places. Daddi is recorded as being artistically active between 1312 and 1347, and scholars estimate that he died soon after.","French"

After moving to Paris in 1785, his reputation grew as a portraitist to the aristocracy. Danloux paid great attention to rendering fabrics, embroidery, and accessories in both oils and chalk. After another sojourn in Rome, Danloux returned to Paris in 1789, where he was commissioned to make portraits of the royal family. Soon theFrench Revolutionforced him to flee to London. Influenced by fashionable English portrait painters like George Romney, Danloux excelled in family groups and portraits of children, whom he captured in natural, spontaneous poses. He also began painting history subjects. He returned to Paris in 1801 and spent his remaining years frustrated by his failure to establish himself as a history painter.","French"

His brothers were stonemasons, his father was a stone carver. In his twelve-year career, Desiderio created sculpture ranging from freestanding statues to crucifixes, but he is best known for portraitbustsand elegant reliefs, especially of theMadonna and Child. Having possibly trained and collaborated with Donatello, he took the master's technique of very lowreliefin a new direction. Though he also worked in wood and stucco, Desiderio had special talent for bringing out the luminosity of marble. Unlike his predecessors, he understood that light sinks into marble crystals, then comes back to the eye, while reflections off nearby surfaces also add radiance. As a result, he seemed to breathe life into his stone subjects, particularly children. In his last works Desiderio renounced polishing: he simply filed the surface, giving the impression of seeing the marble through a light-filled haze. In 1453 Desiderio joined the stone and woodworkers'guildand received his only monumental commission, an important tomb in a church in Florence.","French"

Often working on a monumental scale, di Suvero transforms industrial materials into evocative, dynamic abstractions. His work sometimes features movable elements and actively invites the viewer's participation.Born in Shanghai, di Suvero grew up in California. He studied philosophy and fine arts at San Francisco City College and the University of California at both Santa Barbara and Berkeley. During these studies, he took an interest in art, especially sculpture. In 1957 he moved to New York. His earliest exhibited works were in plaster, wax, and wood.Di Suvero's use of steel developed out of necessity. In 1960, he was crushed  by a freight elevator. Following this serious accident, wood proved difficult to manipulate by hand. In essence, di Suvero used heavy machinery to  draw  in steel, making and erasing gestures on a vast scale. His early steel pieces incorporate railroad ties, scrap metal, tires, and structural steel. This exploration has transformed over time into a focus on modern construction materials like I-beams and heavy gauge metal. Di Suvero does much of the welding, cutting, and crane work himself.In the 1960s, di Suvero protested the Vietnam War in several sculptures. He moved to Europe for four years in the early 1970s. A retrospective of his work at the Whitney Museum of American Art in the mid-1970s brought di Suvero greater prominence and acclaim.

John Divola is from Southern California, and his imagery often reflects that locale by including urban Los Angeles or the nearby ocean, mountains, and desert.Divola grew up in the San Fernando Valley, which he credits as having an impact on his development as an artist. He earned a BA from California State University, Northridge in 1971 and an MA from University of California, Los Angeles in 1973. In college, the new art movements that inspired him--Minimalism, Conceptualism, and Earthworks--were often not easily accessible, but encountered through photographic documentation.  I came to the conclusion that [photography] was the primary arena of contemporary art,  Divola has said,  and that all painting and sculpture and performance was, from a practical point of view, made to be photographed, to be re-contextualized, and talked or written about.  After earning an MFA from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1974, Divola developed his own combination of performance art, sculpture, and installation, with photography at its conceptual core.One of Divola's earliest projects,Zuma(1979), brought him critical acclaim.Zumais a photographic record made over time of a beachfront property that was being used intermittently by the fire department for fire-fighting practice. As Divola observed the building over the course of two years, it was ravaged by fire, vandalism, and the artist's own graffiti. These acts of human  intervention,  as he saw them, became integrated with the inevitable natural processes of decay.Isolated Houses, Divola's vivid color photographs of one-room dwellings in the desert area around Twentynine Palms, California, emerged out of his longstanding interest in the Southern California landscape. At the center of each square image is a square house-sometimes shown close up, other times, at a distance. The physical relationship between each man-made structure and its immediate surroundings blur visual distinctions between what is natural and what is artificial.

Already suffering from depression, Dolci plunged deeper into despair.Dolci's artistic training began at age nine in Jacopo Vignali's studio, where he learned to combine Vignali's emotive approach with the elegant design and bright local color of the Florentine style. Dolci probably also studied Netherlandish painting. Intensely religious, Dolci stated his  firm intention to paint only works that would inspire the fruits of Christian piety in those who saw them.  He specialized in devotional works, although he also earned his international reputation through the portraits and still lifes he intended for his sophisticatedpatrons. Dolci captured detail in lavish textiles, jewelry, and the face and hands.

In 1602 he joined Annibale Carracci and his classmates Guido Reni and Lanfranco, his detested rival, working on the Farnese Palace's ceiling murals. Domenichino painted many of the landscapes, ordering and improving on nature. By 1614 he was Rome's leading painter. He also made easel pictures, sometimes painting on copper to achieve a polished finish. In 1621 he began working as architect for PopeGregory XV, creatingfrescoeswith a more emotional Baroque style.In 1631, with his popularity in Rome waning, Domenichino traveled to Naples to take over Guido Reni's commission to decorate a chapel in the Naples Cathedral. This was a potentially dangerous project: other non-Neapolitan artists had refused or abandoned this commission after jealous local artists threatened their lives and killed a servant of Reni's.

In 1646 he visited his brothers at Nantes, returning to northern France via the Loire valley and sketching chteaux and towns such as Saumur and Le Havre. He made several journeys through the Netherlands and in 1663 he traveled up the Rhine. From 1669 to 1695, Doomer lived mostly in Alkmaar in the northwest Netherlands, where his home still stands.

While on a trip to Paris at age fifteen, he was impressed by the shop of Auber and Philipon, established publishers of caricatures and comic magazines. Calling upon his formidable charm and self-confidence, the boy drew his own versions of the shop's work, presented them to the publisher himself when his parents were otherwise occupied, and landed a three-year contract to work in Paris. So began his largely self-taught career as an illustrator. He also worked as a painter and sculptor, though to his dismay, never with the same acclaim.Dor's father died of pleurisy when the young man was seventeen, which, along with his mother's continuing faith in his abilities (or what some consider her social climbing and greed), pushed Dor to find commercial success as an artist and to support the entire family. He was prolific, and created not just the illustrations to the classics for which he is most known, but also illustrations for novels, comic books, and other journalism. His work ethic, good looks, and personality gained him acceptance into high society, including an audience with the Empress Eugenie. Many notable artists, writers, and musicians were his friends, including Rossini, Dumas, and Nadar (who also photographed him).

What stood out was a palpable feeling of loss...pictures that seemingly read like paragraphs, even chapters in one long, complex, rich narrative.  Soon after graduate school Dow had the opportunity to work with Evans.

Dubois-Pillet exhibited regularly with the Indpendants until 1889, and the only one-man exhibition of his work held in his lifetime took place at the Revue Indpendent in 1888.He graduated from the Ecole Impriale Militaire at Saint-Cyr in 1867and fought in the Franco-Prussian war. In an effort to camouflage his artistic activities from his military career, in 1884 he began to sign works of art  Dubois  with the addition of his mother's maiden name,  Pillet.   Though the military forbade him from participating in art exhibitions in 1886, he remained active until his death.Perhaps because of this defiance, in 1889 he was posted to Le Puy in south central France as commander of the local gendarmerie. He died there during a smallpox outbreak in 1890.The next year, 64 of his works were shown posthumously in a show at the Salon des Indpendants, but due to a reported later fire, his work remains rare today.","Dutch"

By 1656, he was living in The Hague.While not many Dutch soldiers actually fought in the Thirty Years' War---they hired mercenaries for that--paintings of soldiers became popular. Duck specialized in guardroom pictures, though like mostgenrepictures they did not command high prices, and he made etchings depicting gentlemen in contemporary dress. His painted subjects ranged from domestic activities to tavern scenes of boorish soldiers drinking, smoking, and flirting with pretty, young women of dubious virtue. They were often meant to convey moral messages, though much of thesymbolismfamiliar to seventeenth-century audiences is unclear today. Duck often painted large crowds gathered in spacious halls, using every device then known to create the illusion of space: curtains or large objects in the foreground to establish the front plane, orthogonal lines made by the tiles or boards on the floor, vistas into rooms beyond, and aerialperspective.","French"

In 1769 Ducreux was sent to Vienna to paint a miniature ofLouis XVI'sfuture wife, Marie-Antoinette. An instant success, he was made a baron andpremier peintre de la reine(First Painter to the Queen).In the late 1780s, the irascible Ducreux painted  character  self-portraits, using his own face to study various expressions, then a popular field for artistic exploration. While in London avoiding theFrench Revolution, he engraved and published three of these expressive self-portraits and drew the last portrait ever made ofLouis XVI. In 1793 Ducreux returned to Paris, where he became associated with Jacques-Louis David, who helped him continue an official career. Ducreux's rooms became a popular meeting place for artists and musicians, who often commissioned portraits from him; his friend composer Etienne Nicolas Mhul based the main character of an opera on him.

Drer initially trained in Nuremberg as a goldsmith, painter, and woodcutter. After visiting Venice in 1495, he intensely studied mathematics, geometry, Latin, and humanist literature. He expressed himself primarily through prints; painting was less profitable, and Lutheran church reformers disdained most religious artworks. Drer's paintings are few and more traditional than his engravings and woodcuts. In 1498 he published the first book entirely produced by an artist,The Apocalypse, which included fourteen woodcuts illustrating the Book of Revelation. Its vivid imagery, masterly draftsmanship, and complex iconography established his reputation. After visiting Italy again from 1505 to 1507, Drer's art assimilated Renaissance principles. Unlike his earlier, more Gothic woodcuts, Drer's engravings of 1513 and 1514 suggest the influence of Italian chiaroscuro and were conceived in painterly terms, using a range of velvety tones rather than lines. His drawings include studies of hands, draperies, and costume, portraits, Madonnas, and intimate and detailed watercolor studies of nature. Despite the impressive scope of his workshop, Drer left no direct successors, though his easily transportable prints were influential throughout Europe.","Daguerreotypist"

In his late teens, he studied painting with Van Ostade, and his earliest works relied heavily on his teacher'scompositions. After Van Ostade's death in 1685, Dusart took over the contents of the studio and owned both Adriaen's works and those of Van Ostade's brother, Isack. Dusart reworked and sold many of their drawings, and in the process assimilated their styles and subjects. He also completed or adapted oil paintings by Jan Steen, whose style inspired him to develop figures with exaggerated expressions, gestures, and clothing.Dusart's depictions of peasants drinking and carousing were probably not intended as moral lessons about vice, but rather, served as a form of comedy. The satirical side of Dusart's art reflected popular theater, and his published prints had an impact on Dutchcaricature.

His detailedgenre scenes, which he began depicting in the 1650s, anticipate works by Pieter de Hooch.

The Eucharides Painter was one of the few artists to leave a substantial group of vases in both techniques. Working in Athens in the years from about 500 to 470 B.C., the Eucharides Painter decorated a wide variety of vase shapes, from large kraters to cups, with scenes drawn from mythology and daily life.As with most ancient artists, the real name of the Eucharides Painter is unknown, and he is identified only by the stylistic traits of his work, such as the distinctive manner in which he drew the sternum and collarbones of figures.

He signed his name on eighteen vases, six times as painter and twelve times as potter. To judge by their drawing style, the vases that he signed as potter seem to be later than those he signed as painter.In his early career Euphronios was one of a group of Athenian vase-painters who have been named the Pioneers by scholars today. Working about 520 to 500 B.C., they were the first to exploit the possibilities of drawing in the new red-figure technique. Like his colleagues, Euphronios was interested in showing the human body in a variety of poses, and he used overlapping andforeshorteningto give his scenes a sense of depth. On their vases, the Pioneers often depicted one another and even exchanged playful insults about each other. Later in his career, Euphronios's signature as potter appeared alongside the names of several of the finest vase-painters of this period, including Douris, Makron, and Onesimos. The precise details surrounding Euphronios's later role as potter are unclear. Perhaps as he got older and his eyesight failed, he switched to the more tactile, less visual craft of potting a vase. Or the potter signature may mean that Euphronios actually owned the workshop, a sign of his prosperity and success in the industry.","American"

He later studied with Horace Lecoq de Boisbaudran, an innovative and important teacher known for his system of teaching visual memory. Fantin-Latour developed an enthusiasm for Italian painters, especially Titian and Paolo Veronese, and regularly copied their work at theLouvre. It was at the Louvre that Fantin-Latour met douard Manet with whom he forged a friendship; he would later paint Manet on several occasions.By the early 1860s, Fantin-Latour was producing the three genres of painting that would sustain his career: portraiture, still-life painting, and imaginative or mythological scenes. Commissioned portraits and still-life paintings of flowers and fruit were essential to the artist's livelihood and he established an important clientele in England. But Fantin-Latour received the greatest critical attention for a series of ambitious group portraits featuring many of the most renowned artists, writers, and musicians of the time.

Settling in Venice, Fontebasso increasingly emulated Tiepolo in his palette and compositional designs.By the 1740s, Fontebasso had established himself as a leading artist in Venice. Mainly active as a decorator of churches and palaces, Fontebasso worked both infrescoand on canvas. Like Tiepolo, Fontebasso also produced pen-and-wash drawings and executed numerous book illustrations. In 1761, Fontebasso visited Saint Petersburg and produced ceiling paintings and decorations for the Winter Palace. Sadly, like several other of his major decorative projects, this work was eventually destroyed. Fontebasso returned to Venice in 1768 and was elected president of the Acadmie Royale.

In 1498, when he saw Florence's convent of San Marco stormed and its strict, charismatic prior Savonarola dragged to prison, Baccio vowed to become amonk; he became Fra Bartolommeo in 1500. Seeing no distinction between life and art, he allegedly burned his non-religious works and depictions of nudes, considering them sinful. In 1504, like Fra Angelico years before him, Fra Bartolommeo ran the San Marcomonasteryworkshop. He incorporated Leonardo da Vinci's smooth harmonies, spiritual feeling, andsfumatointo his work. To stress the gulf between the divine and the earthly, Bartolommeo was among the first artists to replace contemporary costume with nondescript drapery. By 1508 he was the foremost artist of the Florentine school. Eager to stay abreast of his contemporaries artistic advances, he visited Venice that year and Rome around 1514.

While still studying at Chelsea, she sold her sculptureBirdto London's Tate Gallery. The bird theme would occupy her over the next two decades. Her earliest birds--often menacing, predatory creatures--powerfully convey post-war fears and fascinations.Beginning in the late 1950s, Frink explored her interest in flight by creating sculptures of winged men and a series of figures crashing down from the sky. In 1964, she began a series of haunting soldiers' heads followed by the celebrated  Goggle Head  forms. These menacing male busts, their eyes concealed by sunglasses, portrayed for Frink the brutality of the Algerian war. In the late 1960s, she moved to the south of France. Wild horses in the region inspired many sculptures. On returning to England in 1973, she focused on male nudes with mask-like features and attenuated limbs.Like Alberto Giacometti and Henry Moore, Frink built her forms with plaster directly on a metal armature. She would often carve away from the plaster to create a more dynamic surface. The finished form could then be cast in bronze.

She is drawn to chaotic, idiosyncratic places in which neglected  yard artifacts  give some indication of the lives lived there. In Garen's work the absence of human activity predominates. Yards are neglected and overgrown, seemingly occupied only by abandoned artifacts and the resurgent natural world.According to Garen, her yard scenes  reflect my curiosity about other people's spaces, how their personal spaces intersect with nature, how small details can offer clues about the character and feel of a place.  Garen spent several years photographing yard scenes around her hometown, Ithaca, New York. She has also made a series of still-life compositions, working mostly with decaying plant materials.

What he saw below inspired him to learn how to pilot a plane so he could photograph the American landscape. Garnett's aerial photographs resemble abstract expressionist paintings or views through a microscope. As landscapes, they do not have the conventional grounding of a horizon line. All reveal astonishing patterns that are not seen from the ground.Garnett honed his elegant design sensibility well before earning a pilot's license: Before the war, he attended Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles. Later, he headed the Pasadena Police Department's photography lab. In the 1940s and '50s, he began to rack up flying hours around Los Angeles, speaking out about the area's increasing air pollution. He illustrated Nathaniel Owing'sAmerican Aesthetic, a book about land-use practices.During 10,000 hours of flying, Garnett simultaneously piloted a plane while photographing out the window-traveling above every state and many parts of the world. His light 1956 Cessna plane allowed him to fly to just the right location to capture subjects with precision. At first, he experimented with a variety of camera formats and films but found that two 35mm cameras (one loaded with black-and-white film, and another with color film) best suited his needs.Garnett's work defies the stereotype of aerial photography as purely scientific and devoid of artistry. He became the first aerial photographer to earn the prestigious Guggenheim Award.","French"

Like those of his master, de Gelder'sOld Testamentscenes display strong, warm color; Oriental types and costumes; and interest in the scenes' human aspect. To vary textures, de Gelder applied paint with his thumb, fingers, andpaletteknife. He also scraped and scratched into the wet paint with the butt end of his brush, a technique he probably learned from Rembrandt. Over time, de Gelder gave Rembrandt's palette aRococoflavor by lightening it and using pinks and violets.While de Gelder's contemporaries recognized him as Rembrandt's best pupil and closest follower, they also considered him an eccentric living in the past, using broken dabs of color when smooth surfaces and elegance were the chief aims of Rococo art.

In addition, he provided models for painters to copy and taught a drawing school for about twenty students. Genest was also responsible for decorating some of the factory's most important pieces, although it is difficult now to know which ones, as he rarely marked his works.Genest was paid handsomely for all this work.

He is first recorded in 1408 in Venice, whose artists were famous for their rich coloring; this may explain Gentile's penchant for deep, vibrant colors. Gentile's paintings also feature richly patterned surfaces and people with soft, full faces, heavy-lidded eyes, and dreamy expressions. His lyrical atmosphere, elegant refinement, and attention to detail in rendering landscapes, animals, and costume typify the International Gothic style, originally developed in French and Burgundian courts and used especially inilluminated manuscripts.Gentile's most famous surviving works were made during a short but influential stay in Florence in the 1420s, where he probably encountered the austere realism of his younger contemporary Masaccio.

By 1616 de Gheyn had fully mastered the skills of etching and engraving. That same year, he created a series of drawings,The Wise Men of Ancient Greece,which was overwhelmingly well-received by his contemporaries. This series consisted of seven drawings of individual, seated, elderly figures, wrapped in heavy cloaks and reading the books for which they were best known.

He designed elaborate fountains for the aristocratic patrons of northern and central Italy, especially for theMedici, who wanted to incorporate large sculptural projects into the landscapes of their Tuscan residences. In addition to large-scale projects, Giambologna also created smaller scale works in bronze. His reputation among contemporaries derived in part from the wide distribution of his works through small-scale bronzes.

For ten years, Ginori experimented with different porcelain recipes and collected models and molds for porcelain figures. Finally, in 1746, he began to sell the factory's products to the public. The early works were made from a grayish,hard-paste porcelainderived from local clay, which was extremely prone to cracking. After 1770 the paste was changed to a finer, whiter variety.Under the directorship of Ginori's son, Lorenzo, the Ginori factory produced a range ofpolychromedand whitebas-reliefsof mythological subjects.

Skilled weavers were paid according to the difficulty of the work; those entrusted with heads and flesh tones received the highest wages.During the reign ofLouis XIV, tapestries celebrated the glory of the Sun King, but eighteenth-century subjects were lighter and more frivolous. The most important innovation in eighteenth-century tapestries was the addition ofalentours(borders). These wide frames depicted flowers and architectural devices surrounding a central scene.

For the next 150 years, Flemish painters regularly visited Italy, often adopting an Italianate style of painting. Gossaert's version of the style married Flemish figures with Italianized architectural elements and classical poses. Royal commissions took him to Brussels, Malines, and Utrecht, and his work had wide influence.Called Mabuse because he was probably from Maubeuge, Gossaert was recorded as a master in the Antwerp guild in 1503. In 1515, humanist and longtime Gossaert patron Philip of Burgundy commissioned Gossaert and Venetian artist Jacopo de' Barbari to decorate his Castle Souburg near Middelburg. Philip wanted to surround himself with scenes from classical mythology, giving Gossaert his first major opportunity to explore the nude in movement.

Group E tended to paint a fairly narrow repertoire that included common mythological themes and chariots seen from a frontal view.As with most ancient artists, the true names of the artists who comprised Group E are unknown; they are identified only by the stylistic traits of their work. Scholars have named the group after its most famous member: theEstands for Exekias.","Greek"
"b.  1771 Paris, d.   1835 Meudon, France","photographer","Baron Antoine-Jean Gros","The Group of Boston 10.190 is known from only three surviving vases, all of them choes (oinochoai). These painters worked in thered-figure techniquein Athens in a style that is loosely connected to the workshop of the Meidias Painter. Their work is characterized by figures with long, hanging locks of hair and border decoration surrounding the scenes.As with most Greek vase-painters, the real names of the artists comprising the Group of Boston 10.190 are unknown; they have been grouped under one name because of similarities in their painting style. In fact, the stylistic similarities are so close that the same person may have painted all three vases. Because none of the vases is signed, the name of the Group was derived from the inventory number of a chous now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.","Greek"
"active: 560 B.C. - 540 B.C. Athens, Greece","photographer","Group E","The workshop of the Group of the Floral Nolans produced small vases, such as lekythoi,oinochoai, and amphorae. These artisans worked in Athens in thered-figure techniquein the period around 470 B.C. and appear to have had some connection with the workshop of the Berlin Painter. As with most Greek vase-painters, their real names are unknown, and they are identified only by the stylistic traits of their work.This workshop takes its name from its use of floral decoration and from one of the forms of vessels the painters decorated, the Nolanamphora. This type of small amphora was named for the site of Nola in Italy, where many such vases were found. Most vases made by this workshop were entirely black, except for floral decoration on the shoulder and a band with decorative patterns on the body. The Getty Museum'skalpisis the only example of a large vase decorated by the Group of the Floral Nolans and the only example by this group of a vase with figural decoration.","Greek"
"active:440 B.C. - 430 B.C.","photographer","Group of Boston 10.190","Francesco Saverio II Maria Grue was the last member of the renowned Grue family, long connected with the manufacture ofmaiolicaat Castelli in the Italian Abruzzi region, to play an important role in maiolica production. When he was twenty-seven, after working with his family in Castelli, Francesco Saverio applied to enter the royalporcelainfactory at Capodimonte, founded by the king of Naples in 1758. The factory's manager refused his application, however, on the grounds that the technique of miniature painting on porcelain was different from that on maiolica, the medium to which Francesco Saverio was accustomed.Francesco Saverio finally entered the factory in 1771 and four years later became its director of painting. In 1794 he was promoted to director of thetornanti(ceramists who work on the potter's wheel) and three years later was listed as atornantehimself.","Italian"
"active: about 470 B.C. Athens","Photographer","Group of the Floral Nolans","Francesco Guardi came from a family of artists; both his father and his elder brother Antonio were painters. Francesco established himself as a figure painter in Antonio's workshop but around the time of his brother's death in 1760, Francesco began producingvedute.Guardi's Venetian views were indebted to Canaletto but as an Englishpatronnoted,  Though he has taken Canaletto's department, Guardi has still followed a particular manner; which is spirited and quite his own.  Guardi'sveduteappeared topographically accurate but increasingly, the artist rearranged buildings or altered lighting to improve acomposition. These liberties were not always well-received. Guardi's atmospheric and fantastical views of ruins, known ascapriccio,gave free reign to his imagination.Guardi spent his entire life in and around Venice producing work for local patrons as well as the tourist trade. He was also employed by the government to record state occasions such as the 1782 visit of Pope Pius VI. In addition to paintings and drawings of state visits and receptions, Guardi contributed designs for these celebrations including designs for furniture and parade boats. Toward the end of his long career, Francesco was assisted by his younger brother Nicol and by his son Giacomo. After his father's death, Giacomo Guardi continued the family studio producing paintings both in his father's and his own style.","Italian"
"b.  1731 Naples, Italy, d.  after  1797","sculptor","Francesco Saverio II Maria Grue","Born to an Italian family of artists, Antonio Guardi taught his better-known younger brother Francesco Guardi and presumably took over the family studio in Venice on his father's death in 1716. By 1730 the workshop was producing copies of the Venetian masters such as Tintoretto, Titian, and Sebastiano Ricci for the Field Marshal of the Venetian armies. They also paintedaltarpiecesand portraits commissioned by local aristocrats. The Guardi studio usually borrowedcompositionsfrom earlier artists' paintings and, in the tradition of Venetian family workshops, painted most works in collaboration with other artists employed by the studio.Scholars are still sorting out Guardi's career. He became a founder-member of the Venetian Academy in 1756, but only two of his signed paintings are known. Recent study has uncovered additional documented paintings by him and elevated his reputation. He counterbalanced the eclecticism of the workshop's borrowed compositions with his own brilliant and highly inventive handling of brushwork and color. In the 1750s, his flickering brushwork and light, gay colors prefigured theRococostyle and anticipated the technique his brother Francesco developed long after his death.","Italian"
