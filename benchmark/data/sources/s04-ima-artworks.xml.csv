As Archipenko observed:  in art the shape of the empty space should be no less important than the meaning of             the shape of solid matter. ","Robert Henri was born Robert Henry Cozad in Cincinnati, Ohio. When Henri was ten years old, his father, a             gambler and real estate promoter, shot someone in self defense. The family feared for their safety, moved             to Atlantic City, New Jersey, changed their name and passed their two sons off as adopted children. Robert             Henri chose a variation on his middle name as his surname and attended boarding school in New York City. He             received his art training at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then attended the Academy Julian             in Paris. After spending several years in Europe, Henri taught at the Chase School of Art and the New York             School of Art where he led a fight against Academic views. In 1909, Henri established his own school and             organized The Eight, a group of artists that rejected the restraints from the National Academy of Design.             The Eight favored a style that portrayed contemporary everyday life. Five members of this group, including             Henri, became known as the Ashcan School because of their depictions of the seedy side of life. Henri             favored portraits of ordinary people, while the remainder of the group focused primarily on everyday street             scenes.             This portrait of professional model Edna Smith is typical of Henris ability to capture his subjects             spirit. Around 1909, Henri adopted the color system of theorist Hardesty Maratta, which assigns a letter             and number to 144 harmonically related colors. Painters could use the system of letters and number to             carefully plan the color relationships of their paintings. The rich harmonies of this image based on red             and green show Henris use of the Maratta system.","bronze"

The rhythmic curving lines of the composition suggest the vitality of nature and are characteristic of             Bentons work .","Edmund Brucker was born in Cleveland, Ohio and trained at the Cleveland School of Art. He was an             accomplished painter working in a realist style when he joined the faculty of the John Herron Art Institute             in Indianapolis, where he taught until his retirement. Though he was best known as a portrait painter,             Brucker also painted regional scenes in both oil and watercolor. Many of his works combine views from             sketches and drawings he made of different sites during different times of the day. His palette of rich             gray tones emphasizes design, composition and line. As a portraitist, Brucker painted Indiana governor             Matthew E. Welsh as well as family, friends. He painted several portraits of African Americans, other local             citizens and fellow artists.             Monday Morning is an example of the more modernist idiom Brucker experiments with during the 1940s.             Elements of cubism and a design as precise as an architects are present in the paintings ruler straight             lines, angularity, and compressed space. Like other American artists of the time, Brucker painted back             alleys and industrial landscapes, views which seem to capture the stress-filled American society of the             1930s and 1940s. The bright green spot of vegetation in the center of Bruckers subdued colors and             geometric shapes stands out as a symbol of nature and regeneration amid the urban environment. Bruckers             inspiration for Monday Morning was a sketch he made on a sunny day in the Little Italy section of Cleveland,             Ohio. Monday Morning was exhibited widely, including, in 1947 at the annual national art competition             sponsored by Pepsi-Cola.","bronze with green patina"

This canvas, named after the East Coast railroad line, was painted during the Depression and depicts a             landscape and desolate house along the railroad tracks. The prominence of the tracks suggests Hoppers             recurring theme of transience and the solitude of the traveler.","John Sloan was born in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and moved with his family to Philadelphia where he attended             Central High School. He worked for a print dealer and as a newspaper illustrator. Sloan studied at the             Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts where he met Robert Henri, and moved to New York to become a part of             Henris urban realist circle. Under Henris leadership Sloan and seven other artists opposed the traditional             hold that that the National Academy of Design had exerted over art in America. In 1908 the group, which             became known as The Eight held an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery in New York. Sloan and four other members             of the group painted down-to-earth subject matter which earned them the epithet of Ashcan School, because             critics felt their art was offensive. The Ashcan School artists recorded the bustling activity of New Yorks             lower East Side with broad, vigorous strokes and a conscious avoidance of sentimentality. Sloan taught at             the Art Students League passing on his style of urban subject matter to Reginald Marsh and Raphael Soyer,             who followed in their teachers footsteps.             Red Kimono on the Roof, an unglorified glimpse of a woman, clothespin in mouth, attending to her laundry,             may have been painted from Sloans studio window, which would explain the elevated vantage point. The             pictures sense of immediacy and direct observation is enhanced by the spontaneous brushwork and Sloans             attention to light and shadow.","oil on canvas"

The artist spent his summers painting at Giverny, France near the home of French Impressionist Claude Monet.","Arthur B. Davies was born in Utica, New York and exhibited his talent for painting when he was sixteen. His             family moved to Chicago where he studied at the Art Institute. He went to New York City and continued his             studies at the Art Students League, where he met Robert Henri and George Luks. As with many of the artists             who would later make up the group known as The Eight, Davies began his career as an illustrator. He             discovered his distinctive style of the female nude in a landscape setting around the turn of the             twentieth-century. Symbolic and poetic, these figures were posed in a frieze-like manner against             mysteriously dark backgrounds and seemed to have their roots in mythology. In 1908, Davies joined a group             of artists at an exhibition at Macbeth Gallery which established these artists as The Eight. Davies             became president of the Society of Independent Artists and helped organize the 1913 Armory Show, which             introduced the American public to European avant-garde trends. While Cubism had a short and minor influence             on Davies, he continued to focus on the idyllic figures that were the hallmark of his style.             Many of Davies paintings exude a dream-like quality of detachment from the everyday world. In Across the             Harbor the artist painted a group of female figures, posing their stylized forms in the frieze-like             composition he often favored. The unusual color scheme and the abrupt change of scale presented by the             sailboat heighten the paintings vague sense of otherworldly mystery.","oil on canvas"

After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was             anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education. The             compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at             the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston             Richardson. After they married, they moved to Detroit where her husband served as director of the Detroit             Institute of Arts for the next seventeen years. After Detroit, the couple moved to Delaware where Edgar             Richardson became director of Winterthur Museum and then to Philadelphia where he served on the Board of the             Pennsylvania Academy. During this time Constance Richardson maintained her own studio and painted             landscapes, portraits, and genre subjects. Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling             during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.             Richardson recalled that the site of this painting was the front yard of her familys home at 4314 North             Central in Indianapolis. Yet Richardsons lush green neighborhood scene transcends any specific place to             become a symbol of traditional middle-class America during the 1930s. The yards are large and well tended,             and the house across the street, characteristic of the days before air conditioning, has a broad, striped             awning. Girls in dresses play under the streetlight, a watchful mother include din its reassuring glow.             Richardsons vision of the scene reduces figures, trees, even shadows to simplified geometric forms. The             result is a painting that breathes the essence of a summer evening. Very little imagination is required to             hear the gentle nocturnal sounds of crickets and cicadas.","oil on canvas"

Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana. The young             Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a             year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John             Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams. He             returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie. In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy             with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards. Adams studied drawing and painting             at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich. When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up             a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes. In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the             Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that             traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago. A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.             Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of             Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the regions artists. In 1898,             Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage. In 1901,             Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from             1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as             Brookville.              Shown in New York in 1886, Wash Day, Bavaria is the first painting Adams sent to America for exhibition. It             may be surprising the artist would have chosen this kind ofsimple scene from everyday life for his debut.             The the diagonal lines of the grass and clothesline draw the viewer to the woman hanging her laundry.             Although the forms are solidly rendered in the academic tradition, this sunlit canvas is brighter and richer             in tonality than the dark scenarios preferred by the Royal Academy. Adams always favored Wash Day, Bavaria             and hung it in a place of prominence in his studio when he returned to Muncie.","oil on canvas"

When she was eight years old, her             mother took her to Saturday art school. At sixteen, after the death of her parents, Bobbs went to Paris,             where she studied at the Acadmie Julian. She returned to New York and enrolled in the Art Students             League. By the time she came back to Indianapolis to continue her training at the John Herron Art             Institute, Bobbs had studied with William Merritt Chase, Robert Henri, Kenyon Cox and Frank Vincent DuMond.             She also worked with Charles Webster Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts. At twenty-eight she married             William C. Bobbs, president of the Bobbs-Merrill publishing company, a man twenty-three years her senior.             After the death of her husband in 1926, Bobbs went back to Paris and opened a studio. When she returned to             Indianapolis, Bobbs opened a studio and gallery where she painted portraits of local citizens,             entrepreneurs, and government leaders. Despite coming from a wealthy family and marrying into wealth, which             created a great deal of skepticism regarding her sincerity as an artist, Bobbs proved she was serious by             becoming a very successful portrait painter.             When this figure study hung in Bobbs Indianapolis living room, visitors often mistook it for a self             portrait from her youth. Although the sitters hat and cape did belong to the artist, the model was a young             woman named Jesseca Penn. While a student in New York, Bobbs met the Scotswoman who had just come to this             country and was looking for work. Bobbs painted her and then sent her to pose for Robert Henri who was             teaching at the Chase School in New York. The read-haired model, as she was later known, became a             favorite of Henri and posed for many of his best pictures. The Japanese screen, a stock motif employed by             Bobbss teachers in Boston and New York, creates the bright tones that suffuse the picture. Its vertical             and diagonal bamboo stalks echo the lines of the sitter, deftly integrating the figure with the background.","oil on canvas"

Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase             was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the citys Royal Academy. In 1878, Chase             returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.             He was a member of Americas influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely             influential teacher. Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in             Shinnecock, Long Island. He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the             Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley,             Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia OKeeffe and Charles Sheeler.             In 1870 Chase moved to St. Louis, where his family had relocated after losing their shoe business in             Indianapolis. He hoped to support himself by satisfying the Victorian taste for still-life paintings of             flowers and fruit. This early example of Chases still-life painting suggests his awareness of other             American artists. The hummingbird motif probably derives from the work of Martin Johnson Heade, and the             bouquet recalls John LaFarges floral arrangements. Chase considered flowers the most difficult things to             paint, which may account for their scarcity in his work. Yet in 1872 his success in still-life painting             induced a group of local patrons to allow Chase to resume this education by sponsoring his attendance at the             Royal Academy in Munich.","oil on canvas"

He enjoyed great success as a portrait painting in the Wabash River town of Attica,             Indiana in the mid 1850s.             While in Attica, Hegler received a commission from Dr. Lewis Lyons to paint his daughter Alice. He posed             the little girl and her dog against a background of country road and woodland. Dr. Lyons was a physician and             one of the town's prominent citizens.

Rubins is also known for his             busts of prominent people, including the architect Evans Woolen, President William Henry Harrison and             Indianapolis Governor Henry Schricker. Rubins taught sculpture and anatomy at the Herron School of Art in             Indianapolis.             In his figural sculpture, Rubins usually sought harmonious proportions and a pensive quality, preferring             rounded, ideal forms to the angular or distorted. The balance and feminine grace of this bronze figure             recall early twentieth-century French sculpture by artists such as Aristide Mailllol.","oil on canvas"

His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve. By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron. He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love. Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter. When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth. He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic. Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indianas most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle. In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco. In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             The Bloom of the Grape, painted in Vernon, Indiana, in early November 1893 during what Steele called a             glorious autumn, is the artists best-known landscape. Its title refers to the white gauzy veil, known as             bloom, covering grapes at harvest time. Steele wrote to his wife that he had never seen better color,             such dull reads and crimsons and faded yellows and oranges, in juxtaposition with such royal purples.             These rich color harmonies are captured in this painting in a manner that critic Charles F. Browne described             as conservatively impressionistic, but not wild. The luminosity and color harmonies found in Bloom of the             Grape exemplify the new approach to landscape painting that would earn Steele national recognition for his             modified Impressionist style.","oil on canvas"

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon             hearing of the plight of northern Indianas Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what             became known as Potawatomi Trail of Death, Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana to document their             culture. After thirteen years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in             California. Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known             primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose             not only convey the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is             also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians             and later became the wife of the tribes chief.             The IMA collection contains several paintings by George Winter two of which are titled Scene on the Wabash.             Both of these works portray a group of Potawatomi Indians gathered next to the Wabash River. The figures are             posed in a casual setting, reflecting Winters goal of recording the daily life and customs of these people.             This particular painting concentrates on family activities, particularly women washing clothes in the             Wabash. It exemplifies the type of gathering of the Potawatomi that established Winters reputation as an             artist.","oil on canvas"

He joined his physician father in Kansas             City and began studying at the Kansas City Art Institute. Lawson traveled to Mexico with his father working             as a draftsman and studying at the Santa Clara Art Academy and then went to New York to enroll at the Art             Students League. Lawson spent time at the summer school of Cos Cob, Connecticut where he began painting out             of doors. He travelled to France to continue his studies in Paris at the Acadmie Julian and shared a             studio with Somerset Maugham, who used Lawson as the prototype for Frederic Lawson in his novel, Of Human             Bondage. After returning to New York, Lawson settled in Washington Heights, an area he painted numerous             times. Lawson continued traveling, spending time in France, Spain and in New England painting in Cos Cob,             Connecticut and Cornish, New Hampshire. He taught at The Art Institute in Kansas City and Broadmoor             Academy. Lawson was one of the members of The Eight who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in 1908. He was one             of the three artists in this group who is not considered an Ashcan School painter, because of his focus on             impressionist landscapes rather than the urban realist subjects that fascinated his fellow artists.             April may depict a stretch of the Harlem River near Lawsons home in Washington Heights, New York. Lawson             had studied with American Impressionist John Twachtman and adopted his practice of building up paint in a             thick crust of interwoven cover.

When his fathers business failed, the family came to             Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist. He studied in Paris at the Acadmie Colarossi and             the Acadmie Julian. Prendergast became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who             included Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William             Glackens. Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat             areas of boldly contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning. His complex arrangements have             been described as tapestry-like or resembling mosaics. Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight,             Prendergast favored people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Prendergast             earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors and oils depicting bustling crowds. He             is remembered today as one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of Czanne and turn them into his             personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism. Prendergasts brother Charles was an important frame maker             whose frames can often be seen on his brothers work.             In Glimpse of the Harbor, Gloucester, Prendergast handles this watercolor view of the Massachusetts harbor             with typical freedom, wielding thin washes in loosely knit strokes and allowing broad areas of the white             paper to figure in the composition. Patterns contrast between rigid geometry and curvilinear forms. The             people are characteristically blended into the scene so they do not disturb the rhythm of the composition.","oil on canvas"

His formal education began at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and then in             Dsseldorf, Germany. He also traveled to London and Paris returning to the United States to work as an             artist for Philadelphia newspapers. He roomed with fellow illustrator Everett Shinn and became acquainted             with George Luks, William Glackens, John Sloan and later Robert Henri who, along with Shinn, became known as             the Philadelphia Five. Luks also drew comic strips, but gave up illustration to become a full time artist.             His career as an illustrator drew his interests to painting urban street scenes. Luks had a vibrant,             sometime raucous, personality that is expressed in his lively portraits and urban subjects. He joined             Robert Henris circle in their depictions of city life and became part of the Ashcan School. He was also a             member of the rebellious group known as The Eight who exhibited at Macbeth Gallery in New York in 1908.             Because Luks was a heavy drinker, he became involved in a barroom brawl that ended in his death.             New Years Shooter dates from around the first exhibition of The Eight, who had banded together to oppose             the rigid formulas of academic painting. He shared with Robert Henri an energetic brushwork, patterned             after the dynamic seventeenth-century Dutch painter Frans Hals. Luks sympathized with the powerless              immigrants, the poor, children  and was at his best when portraying them. The colorful palette of New             Years Shooter is in tune with the gaiety and theatricality of the subject.","oil on masonite"

Before graduating, he left Ohio State to study art in New York City             where he became a student of Robert Henri at the New York School of Art. Bellows became associated with             Henris group which was known as The Eight and the Ashcan School. He taught at the Art Student League of             New York, while painting urban New York scenes depicting working-class people. His most important work was             his series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches.             Bellowss fame grew and he began to receive portrait commissions from wealthy New Yorkers. In addition to             painting, Bellows made important contributions to lithography and created more than 100 images. During his             later career, he illustrated a number of books, including several by H. G. Wells.             Portrait of a Boy depicts Meredith Hare, the young son of a wealthy family living in Tuxedo Park, New York.             In a letter to his wife, Bellows wrote that Mrs. Hare had asked for a picture of her son in a stiff white             collar and formal pose. Bellows fulfilled her request but then executed this portrait, which reveals the             details of loose, soft clothing, tousled hair and inquisitive expression, the sitters charmingly boyish             character.

When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth. He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic.

In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             Pleasant Run has been called the masterpiece of Steeles Munich manner. It was painted within months of the             artists return from five years of study in Germany, where he became increasingly devoted to painting from             nature. The canvass dark tonalities, backlighting, and even its composition, relate to Steeles scenes of             Bavaria. Yet as the artist noted in his journal, he remained sensitive to the nuances of the Indiana             landscape, carefully recording its color contrasts and clear light. In 1885 when T. C. Steele painted this             landscape, Pleasant Run defined the eastern and southern limits of Indianapolis.

His early use of the familys walls             as a drawing board convinced his parents that their son need a specific space to express his creativity.             When he was ten, his family moved to Versaille, Indiana and then to Indianapolis. Forsyth started his art             studies with Barton Hays when he was fifteen. He earned his living painting houses with his brother and             used his free time to explore his artistic talents. Forsyth became on of the first student in the newly             established Indiana School of Art and later worked as an assistant instructor at the school. His desire for             more formal training led Forsyth to follow his friend Theodore Clement Steele to Munich to study at the             Royal Academy. During the summer he traveled around Europe and sent the paintings he completed during these             trips home to sell at exhibitions. When Forsyth finished his studies, he stayed in Europe for another two             years then returned to Indiana and set up a school in Muncie with J. Ottis Adams. After the school closed,             Forsyth joined the faculty of the newly opened John Herron Art Institute where he worked from 1906 to 1933.             Well into his seventies, but not prepared emotionally or financially for retirement, Forsyth took             commissions from the Public Works Administration, which had been established to help artists during the             Depression. In 1934 Forsyth had a heart attack and died a year later.             In 1883 William Forsyth entered the Technical Painting Class of Ludwig von Lfftz, where he received a full             grounding the painting of portrait heads and figure studies. In this canvas painted about midway through             his six-year stay in Europe, Forsyth focuses on the time-worn quality of the womans hands and facial             features. Old Market Woman exemplifies the Munich Schools dark tonality and bravura brushwork, derived             from the 17th-century Dutch portraits of Rembrandt and Hals.","oil on canvas"

By age 20 she was one of Lorado Tafts white rabbits, the female assistants who aided him in             his many sculpture projects for the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1894 she sought             training in France, where she eventually established her home and studio. Active beyond her work as a             sculptor, Scudder participated in the womens suffrage movement in the United States, wrote an autobiography             entitled Modelling My Life, and was honored by France as a Chevalier de la Lgion dHonneur. Scudder came             back to the United States nearly every year to seek fountain projects from landscape architects. During the             early 20th century a wide-spread American demand for garden sculpture provided Scudder with many             commissions, earning her the title Woman of the Fountains.             As a young artist in France, Scudder persuaded the successful American sculptor Frederick MacMonnies to             break his rule against taking students. Scudder incorporated MacMonnies lively naturalistic modeling into             Frog Fountain. She said that this bronze was inspired by children she observed in Italy, a country renowned             for its fountain sculpture.

His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve. By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron. He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love. Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter. When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth. He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic. Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indianas most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle. In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco. In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             The young woman in Steeles canvas represents a departure from the Royal Academys preference for older             models. This attractive figure, whose youthful facial features emerge from the dark shadows, is rendered in             brown tonalities against an unadorned, dark background. The setting and execution exemplify the austere             style espoused by Germanys Royal Academy teachers. Lfftz was prone to severe criticism of the sweet             color in his students work and praised such somber and meditative images as Munich Girl.","oil on canvas"

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon             hearing of the plight of northern Indianas Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what             became known as Potawatomi Trail of Death, Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their             culture. After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in             California. Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known             primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose             not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is             also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians             and later became the wife of the tribes chief.             Winters arrival in Logansport, Indiana, coincided with the last months of the Potawatomi in Indiana. His             ambition to record, with an ethnographers attention to detail, the daily life and customs of the Wabash             Potawatomi resulted in scores of drawings, made between 1837 and 1838, which served as the basis for Indian             paintings such as Scene on the Wabash. The Potawatomis contented expressions are at odds with the overall             melancholy of the barren landscape. Winter often included a dead tree in his Potawatomi pictures as a             symbol of their removal from native lands.","oil on canvas"

She studied             with William Merritt Chase and became godmother to his son. New York was the focus of her life, and she             became involved with the Art Students League. In the summers, she went to Ogunquit, Maine to paint             seascapes and teach summer classes.             Ketcham probably painted this young woman during her first year of study with William Merritt Chase in New             York. Its dark, warm tones and freely brushed manner betray the Munich Schools influence, which she             absorbed through Chase. The paintings title suggests the importance the artist placed upon the sweeping             dark oval form of the womans large hat. Its shape and color contrast with the delicate neckline of the             lace-edged blouse.","oil on canvas"

Ottis Adams was born in Amity, Indiana and settled with his family in Shelbyville, Indiana. The young             Adams was fascinated with art and spent much of his time drawing. He enrolled in Wabash College but left a             year later to study art at the South Kensington School in London where he came under the influence of John             Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner, whose landscapes were of particular interest to Adams. He             returned to Indiana and settled in Muncie. In 1880, Adams traveled to Munich to study at the Royal Academy             with fellow Indiana artists Theodore Clement Steele and Samuel Richards. Adams studied drawing and painting             at the Academy and then set up his own studio in Munich. When he returned to Indiana in 1887, Adams set up             a studio in Muncie and began teaching art classes. In 1889, he and fellow artist William Forsyth opened the             Muncie Art School, which lasted two years. Adams participated in a group show of Hoosier artists that             traveled from Indianapolis to Chicago. A critic dubbed the artists in the exhibition The Hoosier Group.             Two years later, Adams, Forsyth and Steele along with other artists in the area, formed the Society of             Western Artists, the first organization dedicated to promoting the work of the regions artists. In 1898,             Adams and T. C. Steele purchased a house in Brookville, Indiana later known as the Hermitage. In 1901,             Adams became one of the first teachers at the newly built John Herron Art Institute where he taught from             1902 to 1906. During the latter part of his life, Adams worked in Florida and Michigan as well as             Brookville.              Brookville, just a few miles southwest of Indianapolis, was far removed from the bustle of the city.             Although only a small town in Morgan County, it was easily accessible by railroad. Local historians do not             remember the exact location of Thornberrys pasture. In this picturesque view of an autumn afternoon, Adams             achieves the impressionist goal of capturing the light and atmosphere of a specific moment. The setting sun             leaves the foreground landscape in deep shadow, the grassy terrain dappled with sunlight, and the middle             ground fully engulfed in a flowing autumnal light. Adams uses a vertical canvas to place a strong emphasis             on the trees that blanket the blue sky with their orange foliage.","oil on canvas"

He studied Fresco painting techniques at the Skowhegan             School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Weaver traveled to Mexico and Europe. He maintained a studio in             New Yorks Greenwich Village for two years. He was the young painter to be awarded the Julius Halgarten for             a circus painting shown at the Annual National Academy of design exhibition in New York City. He also             exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, The Corcoran Biennial, the Carnegie International             and the San Francisco Worlds Fair. After returning to Indiana, Weaver served as foreman in a machine             company until he received a commission in the U. S. Navy. He retired from the Navy with the rank of             Lieutenant and a year later joined the faculty of the Herron School of Art where he taught painting, mural             design, drawing and illustration. Weaver was president of the Circus City Festival, Inc. and piloted a             beautification program known as Operation Facelift in Peru, Indiana for which he was voted Man of the             Year.

He moved to Madison, Indiana and ten years later to             Indianapolis. Before arriving in Indiana, Hilliard was a sailor, a landscape painter in the West, and an art             student in Chicago, where he lost all of his work in the Great fire of 1871. Hilliard left Indiana after             1876 and studied and worked in Europe, primarily England, Scotland and France. Hilliard was known for his             New England landscapes and coastal scenes, which resemble the Hudson River School in their romantic realism.             Sometime after returning to New York from Europe Hilliard added floral subjects to his landscape work.             Hilliard ultimately settled in Washington, D. C.              This small painting of roses is among the most sophisticated works produced in Indiana during the early             1870s. It displays Hilliards fluid brushwork and his subtle control of the contrast of light and dark             tonalities. The slightly unbalanced, casual arrangement of the flowers suggests Hilliard was aware of             Japanese design.

In 1835 he took up residence in Cincinnati, Ohio. Upon             hearing of the plight of northern Indianas Potawatomi Indians, who were being removed to Kansas in what             became known as Potawatomi Trail of Death, Winter settled in Logansport, Indiana, to document their             culture. After 13 years in Logansport, he moved to Lafayette, Indiana, and then spent three years in             California. Shortly after his return to Indiana in 1876, Winter died suddenly. Although he is known             primarily for documenting the relocation of the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, Winter was a writer whose prose             not only conveys the anguish of the relocation but also the beauty of the surrounding countryside. Winter is             also known for his documentation of the life of Frances Slocum, a Quaker child who was abducted by Indians             and later became the wife of the tribes chief.             Winters early training in England exposed him to the traditional pastoral, classically inspired landscapes             modeled after the work of 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain. Although this canvas purportedly             depicts a view of the Wabash River near Lafayette, the graceful trees that frame the foreground, the             measured recession of space, and the warm, dusky light suggest that it is a thoroughly idealized scene.             Landscapes that partially transformed the untamed Indiana countryside into an orderly, ideal world probably             appealed to Winters purchasers.","oil on canvas board"

Steele was born in Gosport Indiana. His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve. By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron. He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love. Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter. When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth. He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic. Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indianas most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle. In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco. In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             Situated between the German towns of Dachau and Schleissheim, the Dachau Moor was a favorite painting spot             for Steele and Forsyth. It offered a serene landscape where the Hoosier artists could spend undisturbed             hours sketching and painting. Here in the dwindling late afternoon light, Steele captures the essence of             the quiet scene. In this richly r=textured landscape, the thick areas of white suggest reflections from the             suns descending rays on the rippling water. The sense of solitude is broken only by the two peasant women             fathering reeds in the dimly lit landscape. Painted near the end of his stay in Munich, the dark,             gray-green tonality of Late Afternoon is a legacy of Steeles academic training.","painted plaster"

He attended Yale University where he received a bachelor of             fine arts degree. Mattison moved to Chicago to work as an assistant for the muralist Eugene Savage.             Although he produced notable murals and paintings of figures and landscapes, Mattison turned to portraiture             later in his career. He won the Prix de Rome in 1928, a scholarship for art students that provided the             opportunity to study abroad. Mattison spent the next three years in Europe, where he was a fellow at the             American Academy in Rome. After his fellowship ended, Mattison moved back to America where he taught at New             York University, Columbia University and the New York School of Design. In 1933, he was offered a permanent             full-time position as the Dean of John Herron Art School in Indianapolis, where he also continued to teach.             Mattisons art is rooted in the classical tradition. He worked primarily in oil to capture the pleasant             aspects of life, including landscapes, community celebrations, and children at play. His 150 portraits             included, U. S. Supreme Court Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sherman Minton, Indiana Governors Paul McNutt             and Harold W. Handley, author Booth Tarkington, and the former president of the New York Stock Exchange Emil             Schram.             Carnival, which should have been a lighthearted subject, is enveloped in an eerie darkness that hangs over             the amusement park like an ominous cloud.

The viewer cannot see the faces of the two women walking             toward the stairs and the people at the bottom of the steps are barely visible in the dim light. Mattison             may have intended to paint a happy event, but the uncertainties of the Depression have clearly found their             way onto his canvas.","oil on fabric"

After graduating from Laurel School in Shaker Heights, Ohio, Richardson was             anxious to attend art school, but her parents thought she should receive a liberal arts education. The             compromise resulted in her studying at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York for two years, and then at             the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, where she met her husband Edgar Preston             Richardson.

Much of her work was done from sketches she made while traveling             during the summer. Richardson was a prize-winning artist who exhibited widely in galleries and museums.             Richardsons love of the landscape is apparent in Hot Sun. Here strong contrasts of bright sunlight             intermingle with dark shadows, and lush green foliage. The dominant tree is stippled with light that peaks             through its dark leaves. Rocks and tree stumps add a rustic element to this serene landscape, while the             houses in the distance and the young boy seated on the stone wall add a human touch. Everything in this             composition suggests a peaceful coexistence between people and nature.","oil on canvas"

He was best known             for his theatrical scenery and landscapes. Glessing also decorated the interior of Old Fellows Hall in             Indianapolis and was commissioned to paint a series of large canvases that illustrate the citys history for             the first Indiana exposition in 1873. Glessing left Indianapolis in 1873 to accept a position as scenic             painter at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.             In 1859, at the time Glessing painted Landscape with Figures, he was in Indianapolis decorating the             Metropolitan Theatre. Glessings landscape shows the influence of Indiana artist Jacob Cox as well as             knowledge of his English heritage. His inclusion of figures turns this romantic landscape into a genre             scene that is reminiscent of the Holy Family, complete with manger, mother and child, Joseph and John.","oil on masonite"

Adams father encouraged his interest in art. The first portrait commission the young boy             received was a picture of a heifer named Gypsy Girl III for which he was paid five dollars. In 1904 Adams             began his art education at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, where he spent four years studying             under William Forsyth. In 1910 Adams traveled with William Merritt Chase and his students to study art in             Italy. A few years later he made a similar trip to Spain with Robert Henri. Adams developed a style of             alla-prima painting, which means all at once, is a method of painting in which the work is completed in             one sitting, usually without the use of glazing or underpainting. These rapidly painted works contain             energetic brushwork and bold, expressive images. Adams was an extremely prolific painter whose subjects             included U. S. presidents, university leaders, authors, artists, society ladies, actors and actresses,             military heroes, sports personalities, musicians, royalty, and governors. At one point in his career,             Adams had studios in Indianapolis New York City and Philadelphia. During the winter he traveled             extensively, looking for exotic areas and interesting subjects.             In terms of awards and honors, Adams may be Herrons most successful alumnus, winning prizes in most of the             major national competitions during his 60-year career. This portrait of the conductor of the Indianapolis             Orchestra, Alexander Ernestinoff, won the Proctor Prize at the National Academy of Design in 1914 and             vaulted Adams into the ranks of the countrys leading portraitists. The flowing brushwork reveals the             influence of Adams principal teacher at Herron, William Forsyth, as well as his instruction in New York             with the American masters of bravura painting, Robert Henri and William Merritt Chase. In keeping with             Chase and Henris method of rapid execution, Adams is reported to have completed the Ernestinoff likeness in             just three hours. According to Adams account of the sitting, Ernestinoff came into the studio and casually             dropped into a chair, still wearing his hat and overcoat. The relaxed pose so appealed to Adams love of             the spontaneous that it became the basis for the portrait.","bronze"

Due to the interest and generosity of several art patrons, Chase             was able to take a five-year trip to Munich, where he studied at the citys Royal Academy. In 1878, Chase             returned to New York City, opened his Tenth Street Studio and developed his signature impressionist style.             He was a member of Americas influential group of impressionists known as The Ten, but was also an extremely             influential teacher. Chase opened the first summer school of landscape painting at his summer home in             Shinnecock, Long Island. He also taught at the Chase School in New York, which he founded, and the             Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His students included such famous artists as Marsden Hartley,             Charles Demuth, Edward Hopper, Georgia OKeeffe and Charles Sheeler.             When Chase painted this portrait of his grandfather, he was no more than eighteen years old and Moses Swaim             just over seventy. Young Chase had only recently begun studying with Indianapolis artist Barton Hays, but             his likeness convincingly portrays the rugged features and earnest expression of this agricultural pioneer.             The tightly brushed portrait is one of Chases earliest canvases. It descended in the artists family,             surviving a house fire and a long period in a Kansas drug store. When it entered the IMA, the image was             marred by soot, small holes and an improperly fitted frame. After treatment in the museums laboratory and             careful reframing, Chases grandfather now reveals the startlingly early prowess of his portraiture.","oil on canvas"

In 1934, Mayer moved to Indianapolis where he became assistant director under Donald Mattison at the Herron             Art School. During this period, Mayer exhibited his paintings at the Hoosier Salon, Herron Art Institute,             Art Institute of Chicago, Corcoran Gallery Biennial, and the National Academy of Design where he won a             prize. He also accepted mural commissions at such places as the post office building in Lafayette,             Indiana. In 1946, Mayer moved to Essex, Connecticut, where he became director of the Hartford Art School of             the Wadsworth Athenaeum. He later became dean of the Art School of the University of Harford in Connecticut             and also served as director of the Wadsworth Athenaeum.             The depression-era mural projects of the Works Progress Administration probably influenced Mayers choice of             grand-scale designs, and although he may never have intended Halloween Carnival to become a mural, it looks             as if it could be a section of an enormous panorama of Halloween revelers. According to the artists wife,             Mayers painting was inspired by Halloween celebrations that were once held on Monument Circle in downtown             Indianapolis.","oil on canvas"

This realistic             view of his mentors shows them judging works of art. Each portrait is carefully constructed to express the             artists personalities, demeanor and facial features. The portrait even shows Forsyth smoking, Stark with a             cane and the signature beards worn by the men.

He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of             sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in             Indianapolis. The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time. By 1835             painting portraits was added to Coxs business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with             John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,             Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen             and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National             Academy of Design. Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire. When             the Indiana School of Art was established in Indianapolis in 1877, Cox became one of its teachers. He             continued to paint and exhibit until his death at eighty one.             Cox often modeled his landscapes after the calm, pastoral views of Hudson River school painters, such as             Asher B. Durand. Landscape near Indianapolis may depict a stretch of Fall Creek north of the city, an area             Cox frequently painted. The three figures in the lower left could be a family about to begin the arduous             transformation from the frontier into the orderly Indiana farmland pictured in the distance. The bridge in             the compositions center reinforces the idea of transition from wilderness to productive land. Coxs soft             brushwork and saturated pastel palette convey a sense of optimism about life in Indiana in the 1860s.","oil on canvas"

While there he produced portraits that             combined photography, drawing and painting. Such works satisfied the local patrons and were popular at that             time. Richards, however, found the work distasteful and left to open his own portrait painting studio in             Franklin, Indiana. He married and moved to Anderson, Indiana where he found employment as a newspaper             illustrator. To enable him to travel abroad to pursue an academic art education, Richards raised money among             his patrons in Anderson on the promise of repayment in pictures. Richards traveled to Munich, Germany to             attend the Royal Academy where he would learn to draw and paint portraits and figure studies using local             models. Richards copied Old Master Paintings in Munichs Alte Pinakothek to send back to his Indiana             patrons. While in Europe Richards contracted tuberculosis and was forced to return to the United States,             where he took up residence in Colorado. His career was cut short when he died of his illness at the age of             forty-three.             Richards completed his training at the Royal Academy in 1887, but unlike the other Hoosier artists, he             showed no interest in landscape painting or any inclination to return to Indiana in the near future.             Instead, he entered the mainstream of professional figure painting in Munich. This portrait, presumed to be             the artists Munich-born daughter Gretchen, epitomizes all the richness of detail and formality associated             with Munich realism. Gretchen is posed in profile against an unadorned background. Her hair and facial             features are executed with exquisite detail. Richards use of dark tonalities is in keeping with his Munich             training, but the delicate pink scarf relieves the starkness of the composition.","oil on canvas"

Hays drew on             barn walls with charcoal and saw his first oil painting at age twenty. He moved to northern Indiana, where             after painting portraits of family and friends, he began accepting portrait commissions to earn a living.             In 1858, Hays moved to Indianapolis, where he became a partner in a photography firm. He tinted             photographsand painted over enlarged prints. Hays was one of the first art teachers in Indianapolis. Among             his students were John Washington Love and William Merritt Chase. Much of his renown came from his ability             to convince Chases father to allow his son to continue his studies in New York City.

After graduating from West Baden High School in 1929,             Hopper attended the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis, graduating in 1933. Hopper was the founder             of the Noblesville Casting Company as well as an artist who painted watercolor landscapes, commissioned             portraits and the American scene with its backyards, alleyways, city streets and workers. He also taught             fine art at the Herron Art School and the Art League.             Hopper painted Blue Monday the same year he received his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Herron. The             paintings title almost certainly refers to the gloomy mood Hopper achieved in his depiction of a backyard             in a rural community at the end of the Depression. Hoppers use of color powerfully evokes the harsh quality             of the scene.

","Maurice Prendergast was born in Newfoundland, Canada. When his fathers business failed, the family moved to             Boston where he was apprenticed to a commercial artist. He studied in Paris at the Acadmie Colarossi and             the Acadmie Julian. Whether in Paris, Venice, or Boston, Prendergast was attracted to the vivid parade of             everyday life. He became a member of the group of American painters known as The Eight, who included Robert             Henri, Everett Shinn, John Sloan, Arthur B. Davies, Ernest Lawson, George Luks, and William Glackens.             Prendergast was considered a post-impressionist because of his use of simplified forms, flat areas of boldly             contrasted colors and rhythmically, decorative patterning. His complex arrangements have been described as             tapestry-like or resembling mosaics. Unlike the Ashcan School members of The Eight, Prendergast favored             people involved in leisure activities rather than gritty, urban scenes. Until 1904 he worked almost             exclusively in watercolor. Prendergast earned considerable attention (but meager sales) for his watercolors             and later oils depicting bustling crowds. Prendergast is one of the first Americans to adopt the ideas of             Czanne and turn them into his personal interpretation of Post-Impressionism. His brother Charles was an             important frame maker whose frames can often be seen on his brothers work.             Prendergast translated the bustling activity of busy park scenes or passing crowds into flat, bold areas of             percolating color arranged like a loosely knit tapestry of contrasting shapes and forms. While his             technique became progressively decorative, Prendergasts themes remained consistent. The site for Park             Salem is believed to be a marine park near Salem, Massachusetts.","oil on canvas"

He traveled with Audubon on a flatboat to New Orleans and drew at least fifty flowers for             Audubons bird paintings. Upon his return to Cincinnati and without further training, Mason became a             portrait artist. In 1834, he left Cincinnati and painted portraits in Michigan and Indiana. He died of             pneumonia at age thirty-four.             The portrait of Marie Jane Andrew, age, 7, was commissioned in memory of the girl soon after she died. She             is dressed in an elaborate early Victorian costume and seated among the objects of her childhood; a sewing             box, school books, treasured sea shells, and a Staffordshire pottery figure of a dog. In addition to             offering a wealth of information about the decorative arts of the period, this portrait is an excellent             example of a self-trained professional portrait artist working in the nineteenth century. Mason had             difficulty rendering such simple objects as a book, a table top, and a chair in proper perspective. The             little girls extremities, too, are less than convincing. The artists sense of composition and design             makes up for any shortcomings in technique. The piping on the childs dress creates an interesting play of             lines with the gold chain about her neck; the window encasements direct the viewers eye to her head, the             focal point of the picture. The portrait is an interesting example of a picture within a picture. The             painting of a boy in the upper left is believed to be the girls brother, James, who had also died very             young.

Coxs grandfather and aunt in Washington, Pennsylvania became his guardians. By             that time the young Cox was already interested in art. He was apprenticed to a tinsmith at the age of             sixteen. In 1830, Cox and his brother established a tinsmith shop, first in Pittsburgh and later in             Indianapolis. The business prospered forcing Cox to pursue his painting during his spare time. By 1835             painting portraits was added to Coxs business. Cox closed his shop and traveled to Cincinnati to study with             John Dunn, returning to Indianapolis to paint portraits of such local notables as Senator Oliver Smith,             Governors David Wallace and Noah Noble, State Treasurer Samuel Merrill, and numerous prominent businessmen             and their families. His success enabled Cox to travel to New York City to study briefly at the National             Academy of Design. Upon his return, he found time to add landscapes and still life to his repertoire.

Farmyard Scene displays an unqualified enthusiasm for the vitality, bounty, and sheer visual appeal of rural             life. Cox continually searched for themes that would appeal to Midwestern patrons, and images of prosperity             derived from working the land must have been popular subjects. The European style of the architecture in             Farmyard Scene suggests that Cox was probably inspired by Dutch and English painting. Perhaps he was             striving to elevate the familiar barnyard scenery through associations with Old World culture. In this             canvas Cox gave prominence to the natural beauty and vigor of the animals and relegated the two women and             the buildings to the shadowed areas of the scene.","oil on paper mounted on canvas"

At the age of sixteen he traveled toIndianapolis and entered             the studio of Jacob Cox. He moved to Cincinnati and then took a trip to Europe and finally settled in New             York, where he set up his own studio. During his time in Cincinnati Eaton became a very popular portrait             artist. In New York he developed a reputation as a skillful painter of womens portraits. When William             Merritt Chase arrived in New York, he was referred to Eaton for assistance in pursuit of his art career.             Eaton was an associate member of the National Academy of design and a member of the Water Color Society and             Artists Fund Society. Although he painted landscapes and a few neoclassical pieces, Eaton is best known             for his portraits and his free brushwork and sensitive approach.             In the Portrait of Amelia Studley Eatons brushstroke appears loose, but the drawing of the sitters face             remains firm and solid. He emphasizes the sitters facial features by placing her against a plain             background frames her through the use of a curtain and the fabric on the back of her chair. To move the             viewer around the canvases he repeats the red of the curtain in the womans dress and the cloth behind her.

He later shared             a studio with Floyd Hopper and William Kaiser in the Old Union Trust Building on Market Street in             Indianapolis. The group became known as the Market Street Artists. Early in his career, Head was a             recipient of many art awards including the J. I. Holcomb Prize from the Indianapolis Art Association and the             Ross J. Beatty Prize from the Hoosier Salon. He was one of the artists selected by Wilbur Peat, director of             the John Herron Art Institute, to represent Indiana in a nationwide exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery in             Washington, D. C. After a short time constructing airplane components during World War II, Head settled into             a dual career as a commercial artist and farmer.             Views of railroad tracks, factories and backs of houses were common subjects for many American painters             during the first half of the twentieth-century. Some artists chose such subjects to portray the social             inequities and the grim ugliness that were part of modern urban life. Although Buildings in Winter depicts             an alley in a working-class Indianapolis neighborhood, the artist has stated that he was more interested in             achieving a strong composition and rich color scheme than in making a social statement. Head organized the             blocky, geometric shapes of the buildings into a solid triangle, implied by the convergence of the stairs on             the left and the slope of the roofs on the right. Buildings in Winter was exhibited at the 1939 New York             Worlds Fair.","oil on canvas"

Gift of Mrs. Herman C. Krannert             Learn More             Debt resulting from an inability to manage money kept Gilbert Stuart on the move much of his life. Born in             North Kingston, Rhode Island and raised in Newport, Stuart was taught by a local Scottish painter who took             him to Scotland, but his mentors death forced Stuart back to America. During the Revolutionary War, he             returned to England to study with the American expatriate Benjamin West. As success came, so did debt which             forced Stuart to Dublin, Ireland and then to America, where he eventually became the most highly regarded             portraitist of his day. A skillful master of his craft, Stuart painted directly on the canvas, without using             any preliminary drawing. By the end of his career, Stuart had painted over a thousand portraits of important             political figures. One of his most famous portraits of George Washington was the Athenaeum Head currently             on the dollar bill.             In this painting, the woman and children are posed against a drawn drape in the style of British             portraiture. The similarity of the colors used in the sash, chair, curtain and trim on the young boys             jacket move the viewers eye around the canvas to encompass all the figures. The woman is wearing a simple,             elegant, robe  langlaise, a gown favored by portrait painters of the period. The womans hair is lightly             powdered and fashionably styled in the coiffure  l'hrisson, or hedgehog, in which the hair was cut short             in the front, frizzed to the ends and then brushed up away from the face.

Steele was born in Gosport Indiana. His family later moved to Waveland where Steele began taking art             classes at age twelve. By the time he was eighteen, Steele was teaching drawing and painting at Waveland             Collegiate Institute. Steele moved to Indianapolis and cultivated a friendship with Herman Lieber, who             became his patron. He studied at the Indiana School of Art with its founder John Love. Lieber raised the             funds to send Steele and his family to Europe. Steele chose to go to Munich because it was less expensive             than Paris and he could study with Frank Duveneck, a prominent Ohio painter. When Steele returned to             Indianapolis, he established an art school with William Forsyth. He did portraits and landscapes, many of             them dark and dramatic, in the style known as the Munich School. When he began to explore the Indiana             countryside, Steele turned almost completely to landscape painting, and his work became more colorful and             gradually more impressionistic. Steele emerged as the leader and spokesman for a group of Indiana artists             known as The Hoosier Group, which included Indianas most important Impressionist painters, including             William Forsyth, J. Ottis Adams, Otto Stark, and Richard Gruelle. In 1902 and 1903, Steele toured the             American West, painting in Oregon and around San Francisco. In 1906, he settled in Brown County in a home             that became known as the House of the Singing Winds.             Schliersee, a resort tucked into the Alps thirty-eight rail miles southeast of Munich, was a favorite             vacation spot for the Steele family. From the shores of Schliersee Lake, Steele depicts the picturesque             quality of the town. Framed by sea and sky, the landscape of farms, cottages and churches is echoed in the             waters reflections. The boat placed to the left of the village provides the necessary balance to complete             the carefully constructed composition.","oil on canvas"

He was born in Philadelphia and received his art             training in Antwerp, Paris and London. His move to Indiana was probably influenced by his Indianapolis             relatives and his friendship with John Washington Love, who had been a fellow student in Paris. Both artists             arrived in Indianapolis in 1876. Bates and Love, along with James Gookins helped establish the first Indiana             School of Art in 1877. The school was short-lived and closed after only two years.             The friendship between Bates and Love is apparent in the inscription on this portrait which reads, a mon             ami, John Love (to my friend, John Love).
