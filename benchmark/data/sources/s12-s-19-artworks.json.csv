A tumultuous group of figures and horses crowds around the feet of Jesus at the left, with rearing horses, the Virgin weeping, and Saint John pointing at himself; but the top left of the composition remains open. With such techniques, Hans von Aachen created an effect of dramatic spaciousness.Von Aachen probably made this large and impressive drawing as a preliminary study for a painting. He first sketched the composition extensively in black chalk, which is particularly visible in the torso and hand of the thief in the upper left corner and in the city of Jerusalem in the lower right. Next he laid in the figure groups in graywash, making extensive use of the white paper for highlights; finally, he worked over the entire composition, defining elements with relatively sparing touches of pen and brown ink.","1587","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00040301.jpg","Hans von Aachen","Pen and brown ink, graywash, and black chalk underdrawing","92.GA.83"

The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal chteau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones. Berenice Abbott, a young American photographer who befriended Atget and purchased many of his prints and negatives after his death, made this print some fifteen years later.","1926","www.getty.edu art collections images l 18990701.jpg","Eugne Atget","Albumen silver print","2002.37.14"

Since weapons were of no use against the creature, Herakles' only option was to strangle it. Herakles battling the Nemean Lion was the most frequently depicted mythological scene in Greek art. In early depictions, Herakles stands facing the lion, but by the late 500s B.C., the combatants were depicted down on the ground, stretched out in opposite directions.On this Athenianred-figurekalpis, a tree bends over Herakles and the lion, a rare example of landscape elements in Greek art. Throughout theArchaicperiod and into the earlyClassical, vase-painters focused so completely on the figures in theirnarrativescenes that they excluded almost all background elements. Scenes played out in a sort of visual vacuum without any setting at all. On this vase, for example, the tree serves only as a marker to indicate that the action takes place outdoors.The kalpis is the rounded form of ahydria, or water vessel, favored by red-figure artists in this period.

As was typical in the work of the Affecter, the figures, both dancers and observers, gesticulate strongly, but there is little meaning in their gestures. For all the apparent activity, the figures are quite passive. The Affecter put so little emphasis on thenarrativecontent of his work that scholars often have difficulty determining precisely what is being depicted. For example, some scholars interpret the figures on the back of the vase as dancing, while others see a scene of courtship. Nonetheless, all the figures are beautifully drawn with dramatic silhouettes emphasized by long angular limbs. This vase stands outside the normal stylistic trends for Athens and was probably designed for export to Etruria. TheEtruscansimported large quantities of Greek vases, and certain Athenian artists appear to have focused on this market, adapting their product to Etruscan taste.","470","www.getty.edu art collections images l 01408601.jpg","Aegisthus Painter","Terracotta","86.AE.230"

On the back of the vase, Theseus battles the Minotaur. The Affecter depicted the two great heroes of the Greeks, Herakles and Theseus, battling monsters, symbolic victories of Greek civilization over the barbarians, yet he did not appear very interested in the stories. For example, in Greek mythology, Herakles battles two centaurs, Pholos and Nessos.The depiction on this vase is quite unusual for Athenian pottery of the time, because the Affecter did not provide the clues that would identify which encounter was represented here. It is, however, quite typical for the Affecter, who focused primarily on the decorative aspects of figures. His unusual approach to potting is also evident on this vase, where he threw an old-fashioned neck-amphora form but modified it by adding a raised ring to separate the neck from the body. The oddness of the Affecter's style may be explained by the fact that he appears to have been creating vases for export to Etruria.

These teachers, who specialized in various aspects of education, provided training for the male children of parents who could afford to pay the tuition. The most basic education in one of these schools would have involved reading and writing and perhaps arithmetic. At about the same time, scenes of youths at school learning their lessons began to appear on Athenian vases, part of a growing interest on the part of vase-painters in depicting scenes of daily life.This smallred-figurecup fragment shows a boy holding a scroll while another person, perhaps his teacher, stands in front of him. Scholars have disagreed over what the scroll says. Some read it as the beginning of a list of mythological figures. Others see it as a fragment from an epic poem by Hesiod,  The Catalog of Women.  The latter interpretation may be more accurate since all other scrolls in school scenes contain epic poetry. Schoolboys were made to memorize the works of great poets, especiallyHomer, as moral instruction.This school scene comes from the interior of the cup.

The jar balanced on the well, the flamingolike camels in the background, and the jewel-laden chest in the foreground are elements of this story. The plaque is based on a mid-seventeenth century image of Rebecca and Eliezer by Jacopo Amigoni, whose paintings and engravings often served as a model for the decoration of plaques and tapestries.

This drawing is the second in a series of five preparatory studies Heinrich Aldegrever made for a set of engravings. The series illustrates the Biblical story of Dives and Lazarus from the Book of Luke. Lazarus, a pauper, lived outside the gates of Dives's afluent home. While Dives lived in luxury, Lazarus lived off the crumbs from his table. When the two died, Lazarus was taken to heaven, while Dives went to hell. Dives was punished for eternity because of his mistreatment of Lazarus on earth.Although the story takes place in the early Christian era, Aldegrever placed the figures in a fashionable interior of the 1500s. Artists often chose to use contemporary settings to make it easier for their viewers to identify with the characters. Dives's feast takes place in a sumptuous interior decorated with bottle glass windows. On the floor, glass vessels fill a wine cooler. Elaborately attired figures seated around the banquet table fail to show the beggar any charity.

Algardi sculpted the delicate lace mantle in low relief with subtle contours that reveal how the garment fell around the sitter's shoulders. The strand of pearls, which weaves across the sitter's chest and around her sash, is carved entirely in the round.

In the background, Neptune, ruler of the sea, brandishes his trident and rides in a shell chariot drawn by two hippocamps (sea horses).In this drawing, Alessandro Algardi combined idealization of the human body derived from classical sculpture with convincing, realistic representation based on close observation of the human form. His energetic use of chalk imbued the scene with movement and caught the effect of light, particularly in his modeling of Venus's soft skin and the tritons' muscular flesh.Algardi most often made drawings in association with sculptural projects. As the master of the illusionistic pictorial relief during the Baroque era in Rome, he may have designed this arrangement of figures for a low-relief sculpture, possibly for execution in embossed metalwork.

Until the Spaniards' arrival, the horse was unknown in Mexico, and it remained alien to that culture for many years. When the Aztec people saw a horse for the first time, they mistook the formidable animal and its rider for one single being.

Manuel Alvarez Bravo selected works from his own library for this composition, which suggests a towering form of modern architecture. At the bottom of the stack is Maurice Raynal's 1922 monograph on Picasso, a foundational text that greatly influenced Alvarez Bravo. Picasso's work encouraged the artist to experiment with abstract and cubist compositions. The viewer can only speculate about the contents of the books stacked on top of the monograph, but it is likely that these volumes were equally important to Alvarez Bravo's development as a photographer.This formal, abstract image indicates that, by 1930, Alvarez Bravo had absorbed many contemporary modernist ideas, even though he lived in Mexico City, far from the main centers of avant-garde artistic production.

Christian missionaries, eager to convert the indigenous people, persuaded them to renounce their worship of Otzocteotl, a deity to whom they offered prayers and sacrifices. The miracle occurred when the venerated statue was found shattered and in its place rose a crucified figure.

He began by quickly jotting down a first idea, then, as in the kneeling figure on the recto, he made studies of individual figures, checking them against a live model. He also used sculpture as a source. Del Sarto then developed the initial composition into a sequence of studies drawn in rapid, soft strokes of black or red chalk, which led to the final version for the painting.

Although vase-painters in the closing years of the 500s B.C. began to show an interest in the setting of their scenes, the depiction of battle in an architectural setting is very rare in Greek art.

It served as a prison during the French Revolution, and the senate assembled there during the reign of Napoleon.","1902","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06999701.jpg","Eugne Atget","Albumen print","90.XM.64.37"

A clear depiction of the photographer at work is also evident: Eugne Atget appears in profile, standing at his camera in the lower-center pane of the shop window, as though he is a miniature automaton prominently placed for sale. It is almost impossible, in fact, to tell where the reflection of the street ends and the contents of the shop begin. A lamppost appears to be up for sale alongside a mantel clock; a wagon wheel is displayed just under a cherub to the right of the vases. The overlapping of the contents of the antique store with the everyday objects of the rapidly urbanizing city suggests that Atget was making a commentary about the reduction of Old Paris into nothing more than a collection of curios.","1902","www.getty.edu art collections images l 06999801.jpg","Eugne Atget","Albumen print","90.XM.64.38"

Love of glory has the same subtleties as the most tender passions.  He and his ministers often sponsored such works, using allegorical figures and symbols to convey narrative meaning. The trophies of armor signify military skill, and the fleurs-de-lis adorning the shield and garments of the figure in the ceremonial chariot were an emblem long associated with the French crown.","1903","www.getty.edu art collections images l 07125101.jpg","Eugne Atget","Albumen print","90.XM.127.3"

Perhaps he had the Bibliothque Historique in mind as a client for a series of photographs he made of Parisian interiors belonging to people of various social classes. This room was undoubtedly the most luxurious of all, located in an ornate building then serving as the Austrian Embassy.In this relatively close-up view, Atget focused on a fireplace with an elaborate clock and candelabras on its mantel, and two floral-patterned chairs on either side. The fireplace is filled with a large mirror that reflects a slipcovered couch, and on it, Atget's hat and overcoat. The photographer's tripod-mounted camera is nearby with a black focusing cloth draped over it. These items suggest the image as a kind of self-portrait, although Atget probably did not intend it as such.Atget was so personally interested in the history of Paris that he spent years documenting the city.

Abbott once remarked that  the photographs heralded as art in France in the early part of the century were the worst arty pictorials that existed anywhere.  Especially offensive to Abbott was the way photographers presented their female subjects as inane pictures of the  pretty.

The photograph is a study of textures and the visual trickery associated with the street-fair trade. Like a good sideshow attraction, it seduces with its grandiose columns, marble surfaces, and larger-than-life painted illustrations, but what lies within may or may not measure up to such promises.

The park at Saint-Cloud originally surrounded a royal chteau, and contained sculptures, fountains, reflecting pools, and a manicured lawn. This photograph's dynamic composition reflects some of the garden's formal elements. The picture also displays the increased expressiveness that characterized Atget's last works.Contrary to accepted photographic practice, Atget aimed his camera toward the sun, blocking it with the silhouette of a large tree in the foreground. The viewer's perspective is similar to what would be seen sitting underneath the tree's canopy. The tree frames the receding landscape's horizontal bands of light and dark: a wall of foliage in the far distance, a reflecting pool in the center, and a stretch of grass in the foreground.Atget's asymmetrical composition is radical for its elegant simplicity--an effect somewhat heightened by the print's high-contrast tones.

After Valori's death, the collection remained intact, becoming part of the Uffizi Gallery's collection in 1866. Baldinucci also made duplicates for his own collection. These duplicate drawings, unbound from the book in which he collected them, were dispersed at London sales in the 1760s. Scholars are uncertain about the identity of this sitter. Theversodisplays an accidental offset from another portrait drawing, most likely by Baldinucci, which suggests that this drawing probably came from his book of duplicates.

An account of Peisistratos's return from exile, in fact, describes how he had a woman dressed as Athena ride in the chariot with him. This vase was broken and extensively repaired inantiquity.

He left the kneeling figure of Saint Mary Magdalene unfinished in the right foreground, though she appears in a similar pose and position in the later, more colorful oil sketch and the finished painting.Barocci commonly used an elaborate preparatory method for planning his pictures. After determining the form of a composition, he made several chalk studies for each figure, including separate studies of the limbs and head.

Without the use of a camera or lens, Hippolyte Bayard carefully arranged a delicate selection of laces and flora on a sheet of paper that was made sensitive to light with a combination of iron salts that produced a blue-tonedcyanotypewhen developed. The sheet of sensitized paper with the objects placed upon it is exposed to sunlight in order to make a camera-lessphotogenic drawing.The opacity of the object blocks the light in relation to its density, thus creating a silhouette of the object on the paper. Because the process was relatively uncomplicated, cyanotypes provided a quick method of recording easily recognizable shapes and patterns. Bayard filled the entire sheet of paper, creating a catalog of specimens that reveals the basic structure of each flower, leaf, feather, and scrap of fabric.","1745 - 1749","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00614401.jpg","Joseph Baumhauer","Oakveneeredwithsatin rouge;gilt bronze mounts; modern leather top","71.DA.95"

These graphical forms support the photograph's gridlikecomposition, which seems curiously at odds with its gentle framing. The oval mask may have been an attempt to soften the subject's starkness, following a fine-art approach adopted by photographers in the 1800s.Bayard made many views of Paris in the early years following photography's invention, favoring the British-inventedcalotypeprocess over France'sdaguerreotypeprocess. He created this photograph several years before working on a series of architectural studies for the Commission des Monuments Historiques'Mission Hliographique,a French government-sponsored project to record historic buildings around the city.

They learned about foreign plants such as tea, coconuts, ginger, and pineapples, as well as images of their harvesting, from botanical engravings.

The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.","1887 - 1893","www.getty.edu art collections images l 30773201.jpg","Felice Beato","Albumen silver print","2007.26.203.49"

His keen interest in anatomy was a typical manifestation of the emphasis that theRenaissanceplaced on the study of the human form.Beham also varied the level of finish on each skull. He chose to simply outline the right skull with black ink and to use a more complex technique of hatching and cross-hatching to create the shadows and hollows of the base on the center one. The left skull, with its iridescent brow glowing with white bodycolorheightening, a bold outline, and the use of gray wash to cast shadows and create depth, emphasizes Beham's graphic expressiveness.

Artists typically portrayed such figures in motion, striding forward with a flag fully unfurled, but Beham chose a static, frontal composition instead. The standard bearer strikes a classical contrapposto pose to balance the visual and actual weight of the massive flag, drawn with delicate penmanship.The standard bearer wears an elegant doublet with wide, flowing sleeves that have been quite literally  torn to ribbons.  The fashion for slashing garments became extremely popular in Europe in the early 1500s, particularly in Germany, where it reached the most extravagant levels. Tailors cut slits in the clothing and pulled the lining through to show off its different color. In the same lavish style, the man wears tights held up with ribbons tied below the knee and a broad hat covered with multiple long plumes. Throughout the drawing, the nineteen-year-old artist used distinctive strokes such as the short, hooked lines on the man's thighs and gnarled collarbone.

Personal prayer books played an important role in the daily spiritual life of clergy and laity alike. In the later Middle Ages, as the devout sought a more personal and intimate approach to spirituality, their books became increasingly individualized in their content and decoration. The text of this book is a collection of sixty-two devotional prayers, the majority of which focuses on Jesus' life and Passion. It was copied from a book printed in Augsburg in 1521, a German translation of the original Latin text. The Cardinal, however, chose to commission a hand-written and illuminated copy, probably preferring the luxuriousness of parchment and color-saturated images to the paper and monochromatic woodcuts of printed books. He selected an artist who could bring out the rich narrative and subtle psychological elements in the story of Christ's Passion. The sequence of forty-one brilliantly colored, full-page miniatures that Bening produced for the manuscript was designed to evoke an intense empathic response as the viewer contemplated Jesus' suffering.","1968","www.getty.edu art collections images l 04055501.jpg","Bernd and Hilla Becher","Gelatin silver print","84.XM.125.68"

At left, partly shrouded in shade, a woman serves two seated men. Above this trio, two pairs of tiny figures explore the upper reaches of the towering ruin behind the inn.Nicolaes Berchem is best known for his imaginary Italianate landscapes. In these panoramic paintings, figures generally play a secondary role. By contrast, inThe Return From the Hunt, Berchem focused on the interaction between figures and architectural setting rather than the landscape. The unusual vertical format showcases the artist's command of light. Light falling on the mounted horseman also illuminates the woman on the balcony as well as the figures on the left.Hunters at rest was a popular subject among northern genre painters in the 1600s.

At the base of the image, Berents adds his signature, and a reference to his unusual dual career as a mathematician.This work is part of a long tradition of Dutch genre scenes. In particular, Berents' detailed landscape evokes those by an earlier Netherlandish artist, Pieter Bruegel. Much like Bruegel's figures, Berents' skaters have a somewhat comical air about them due to the extra long blades on their ice skates.

Even at this young age, Bernini was such a skilled marble sculptor that he could differentiate the textures of pudgy flesh, soft hair, waves of water, and dragon scales. A hole in the dragon's mouth shows that the sculpture was used as a fountain.The infant Hercules, who demonstrated his divine strength even as an infant by slaying poisonous serpents, appears here as a mischievous boy who smiles, sits on the dragon, and breaks its jaw with his bare hands. Common in Hellenistic statuary, the theme of Hercules and the serpent was revived in sculpture of the early 1600s. Bernini probably based the composition of his work on an antique work, but contemporary concerns also played a role. He may have represented the serpent as a dragon because his patron, Barberini, wished to convey a satirical message about another important Roman patron, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, whose family coat of arms included a dragon.","1525 - 1530","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11043901.jpg","Simon Bening","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","MS.

His unruly hair and beard and the billowing drapery that winds around his muscled figure evoke the sense of a whipping wind over the ocean. The flattened planes with which the sculptor modeled the muscles on the chest, arms, and legs heighten the feel of strength in the figure's movements. His intense focus on an unseen object before him adds a menacing tone. This drama of physicality and motion is characteristic of the Baroque style.The tabletop bronze is a reduced variant of a marble fountain sculpture made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini around 1620 for the garden of the great collector and patron, Cardinal Montalto, in Rome. All of the four known versions in bronze include a long-bodied dolphin between Neptune's legs, replacing the figure of a triton who served as a supportive strut on the marble statue. Reductions in bronze are unusual in Roman sculpture of the time; the multiple reproductions of Neptune are probably due to the celebrity of its maker, who dominated Roman sculptural production in the seventeenth century.","1525 - 1530","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11044001.jpg","Simon Bening","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","MS.

Gian Lorenzo Bernini swiftly outlined the shapes of the rock formations as well as the marine god and dolphin. Using some blunt tool, perhaps even a thumb or finger, he softly smudged the lines to create the shadows that form the contorted pose of the god's muscular torso. Between 1652 and 1653, Bernini sent studies for fountains to Duke Francesco I d'Este for his palace. Other craftsmen transferred this particular design into a terracotta model, and then local, less accomplished workers produced a more static stucco fountain for the central niche of the palace.","1525 - 1530","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11044201.jpg","Simon Bening","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","MS.

A steep hillside ridge in the distance echoes this line of light tracing the roadway, dividing the image into thirds. At the painting's center, horizontal shapes meet vertical ones, created by the upward thrust of village dwellings. Interestingly, the artist's careful observation of light both enhances and obscures this obsession with geometry. Late afternoon sun throws most of the scene's natural and manmade subjects into shadow, with surprising punctuations of color and light in the sky and foreground.Bertin's Neoclassical approach to landscape painting reflects that movement's emphasis on structure and form, as evident here in a calculated arrangement of forms for overall harmony. Like other landscape painters of his time, Bertin made outdoor sketches not to exhibit them, but to record the effects of light and atmosphere so he could recreate them in highly finished works made in the studio. This sketch was meant to inform those polished yet imaginary landscapes, making them more convincing to the eye.","1525 - 1530","www.getty.edu art collections images l 11044301.jpg","Simon Bening","Temperacolors, gold paint,gold leaf, and ink onparchment","MS.

The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him.

Cybele, who personifies Earth, leans over two kneeling lions. Triton and Nereid emerge from the sea, representing Water. Zephyr, the Wind, reaches toward Jupiter--who, in the form of an eagle, holds a bolt of lighting that symbolizes Fire.In this sculpture, Louis-Simon Boizot varied the depth of carving to simulate space and physical presence. The foreground--the lions and Cybele, Nereid with her offering of sea treasures--pops forward. The sky with Zephyr and Jupiter, the drapery behind Friendship, and even the lions' rear ends, appear to recede into the background. Considering that the depth of this relief is less than three inches, the illusion of dimensionality is remarkable. The frame carved as part of the sculpture, and the fact that the figures don't protrude beyond it, however, evokes two-dimensional media such as painting.","1798 - 1799","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00652701.jpg","Guillaume Benneman","Oak veneered with ebony and lacquer; set withpietre dureplaques; solid ebony legs; gilt bronze mounts;bleu turquinmarble top","78.DA.361"

In the vision, Fra Guala saw Dominic ascending into heaven on a ladder held by Christ and the Virgin Mary. Beneath this scene, clergy and friars perform funeral rites over the saint's body. Nearby, the poor and infirm gather, hoping to benefit from the saint's relics. These figures did not feature in Fra Guala's vision, nor are they mentioned in textual accounts of Dominic's death.

This spotlight effect focuses our attention on Bonvin's self-assured gaze and his unsparing self-introspection in black chalk.When Bonvin drew this self-portrait he was about thirty years old. His artistic career was gaining momentum after his first successful exhibition in 1844. Like many Realist artists, Bonvin looked to Dutch artists of the 1600s, whose works could be viewed at the Louvre, for his models. Rembrandt was especially important to Bonvin and this drawing recalls Rembrandt's many dramatic, probing self-portraits.

The manufactory turned to artist Franois Boucher who had already established himself as a tapestry designer. Boucher created preparatory oil sketches of the scenes, known ascartoons, which were used to weave the tapestries at the Beauvais manufactory. The series challenged the art of the weaver to simulate an array of surfaces and textures--from polished marble and mirrors to clouds and trees. The king's order stipulated six scenes, but Boucher prepared only five. The Getty owns four tapestries from the series.The myth ofCupidand Psyche first appeared in literary form around 150 A.D. Psyche, a beautiful young maiden, aroused the envy of Venus, the goddess of love. Venus was determined to see Psyche spend her days unloved and alone. ButVenus'sown son, Cupid, fell in love with Psyche. Cupid had Psyche brought to his palace where he visited her only after dark, forbidding her to set eyes on him. But one night Psyche took a lamp and gazed at the sleeping Cupid; he awoke and left her angrily. The abandoned Psyche wandered across the earth seeking her love and performing apparently impossible tasks, set by Venus, before finally winning Cupid back. The myth was extremely popular in the early 1700s and formed the basis for several theatrical productions.Jean-Baptiste Oudry also assisted with these tapestries.","1660 - 1670","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00132601.jpg","Johan Ludwig Biller the Elder","Gilt silver","85.SE.442"

Amid all this attention, Venus remains impassive, decidedly detached from the churning sea.Franois Boucher's immense popularity in eighteenth-century Europe was matched by his versatility; he created everything from cabinet paintings to tapestry and stage designs. But this drawing is one of only three known gouaches by Boucher. In this work, the painter loosely applied the media--his handling varying from the expressive, almost chaotic, energy of the sea to the delicate, linear touch applied to Venus and her female attendants. Given its large size and ambitious composition, the gouache was probably created as an independent work of art and not as a study for a painting. Boucher frequently depicted this goddess, and the gouache bears a striking resemblance to hisVenus on the Waves, a later oil painting also in the Getty's collection.","1872","www.getty.edu art collections images l 00015601.jpg","Bartolomeo Biscaino","Red chalk heightened with whitegouacheon tan paper","86.GB.6"

A tapestry of this size would take over three years to complete.","360","www.getty.edu art collections images l 10538201.jpg","James Wallace Black","Albumen print","92.XM.45"
