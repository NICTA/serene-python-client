abstract="Semantic models of data sources and services provide support to 
automate many tasks such as source discovery, data integration, and service 
composition, but writing these semantic descriptions by hand is a tedious and 
time-consuming task. Most of the related work focuses on automatic annotation 
with classes or properties of source attributes or input and output parameters. 
However, constructing a source model that includes the relationships between 
the attributes in addition to their semantic types remains a largely unsolved 
problem. In this paper, we present a graph-based approach to hypothesize a rich 
semantic description of a new target source from a set of known sources that 
have been modeled over the same domain ontology. We exploit the domain ontology 
and the known source models to build a graph that represents the space of 
plausible source descriptions. Then, we compute the top k candidates and 
suggest to the user a ranked list of the semantic models for the new source. 
The approach takes into account user corrections to learn more accurate 
semantic descriptions of future data sources. Our evaluation shows that our 
method produces models that are twice as accurate than the models produced 
using a state of the art system that does not learn from prior models.",

abstract="Semantic labeling is the process of mapping attributes in data 
sources to classes in an ontology and is a necessary step in heterogeneous data 
integration. Variations in data formats, attribute names and even ranges of 
values of data make this a very challenging task. In this paper, we present a 
novel domain-independent approach to automatic semantic labeling that uses 
machine learning techniques. Previous approaches use machine learning to learn 
a model that extracts features related to the data of a domain, which requires 
the model to be re-trained for every new domain. Our solution uses similarity 
metrics as features to compare against labeled domain data and learns a 
matching function to infer the correct semantic labels for data. Since our 
approach depends on the learned similarity metrics but not the data itself, it 
is domain-independent and only needs to be trained once to work effectively 
across multiple domains. In our evaluation, our approach achieves higher 
accuracy than other approaches, even when the learned models are trained on 
domains other than the test domain.",
