This project illustrates the final output of the data integration project.
The final output is the learnt or user provided semantic source description.

In the folder [data](https://github.com/NICTA/SemanticModellingDemo/tree/master/data) 
there are examples of [source descriptions](https://github.com/NICTA/SemanticModellingDemo/tree/master/data/source_descriptions) 
for [relational datasets](https://github.com/NICTA/SemanticModellingDemo/tree/master/data/sources).

The visual representation of the semantic source descriptions can 
be found [here](https://github.com/NICTA/SemanticModellingDemo/tree/master/data/ssd_png).
